VISKids provides child care grants since 2015.
New in 2017, we also organize activities at the conference, and have a meeting room at the site.
The activities and the room are *open to everyone,* not just awardees of the child care grant program.


### VISKids Child Care Grants

Grants of up to $500 per family are available for VIS attendees who are bringing small children to the conference or who incur extra expenses in leaving their children at home. The grants will be given as a reimbursement for expenses but attendees are responsible for making their own arrangements for child care. If requests exceed available funding, or if additional funding becomes available, preference will be given to students and early career attendees who are presenting at the conference.

See the dedicated page for [child care grants](./viskids-child-care-grants) for details.


### VISKids Room

Throughout the duration of the conference,
VISKids will have a room for meetings, discussions, play,
and personal considerations. Kids are very welcome!

- **Location:** Room 208

### VISKids Hello

At the beginning of the conference,
we will have a short gathering
to inform about the VISKids grants and activities.
The VISKids co-chairs will answer all questions.
Everyone is welcome.

- **Location:** Room 103-B
- **Time:** Monday, Oct 2, 12:15pm - 12:45pm


### VISParents Meetup

Whether you are a new parent, expectant parent, experienced wise parent, or considering some day to be a parent, come attend the first VISParents meet-up to discuss work-life balance topics at VIS.  In this open roundtable conversation topics will include work-life balance in general, going into academia versus industry, balancing time with your VISKid, going on parental leave, being a VISParent while completing your dissertation as a student, and being a VISParent while trying to achieve tenure as a professor.  Please come share your wisdom and experiences in this open supportive VIS environment.  Kids are also welcome to attend.

- **Location:** Room 103-B
- **Time:** Tuesday, Oct 3, 12:15pm - 2:00pm


### _Dear Data_ Studio

VISKids and VISAP jointly present a special event with the [VIS capstone speaker](../../capstone) **Giorgia Lupi**, an award winning information designer who co-founded and is design director of the data-driven design firm Accurat.

Giorgia is co-author of _Dear Data_, an inspirational hand drawn data visualization book.
She brings the spirit of this book to VIS in a live participatory visualization session.
The audience will be asked to manually visualize data (draw!)
following the visual language of different abstract paintings.
Giorgia will guide the process. Children are welcome to attend.

- **Location:** Room 103-A
- **Time:** Thursday, Oct 5, 4:15pm - 5:55pm
