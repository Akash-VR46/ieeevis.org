We are working with [Conference Share (conferenceshare.co)](http://conferenceshare.co) to assist in connecting people for room sharing. 
You can register and look for roommates for our conference hotel. 
You can also use this service to share a car rental. 
Please go to the VIS 2017 page in the pull down and you can register for the service with no fees or further obligation.

We do not assume any liability for these arrangements.

If you have difficulty booking rooms, please contact [liz@ctocevents.com](mailto:liz@ctocevents.com).
