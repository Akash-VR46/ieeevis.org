The **IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (IEEE
VAST 2017)** is the leading international conference dedicated to
advances in visual analytics. The scope of the conference, co-located
at VIS with the annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference and
the IEEE Information Visualization Conference, includes both
fundamental research contributions within visual analytics as well as
applications of visual analytics in science, engineering, medicine,
health, media, business, social interaction, security and
investigative analysis, and other disciplines. We invite you to
participate in IEEE VAST 2017 by submitting your original research and
application papers.

Following the successful two-track arrangement in previous years, IEEE
VAST 2017 will again feature an expanded set of accepted papers in two
categories:

* **TVCG Track**: Papers that exhibit the highest quality in terms of
  originality, rigor and significance will appear in a special issue
  of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics
  (TVCG). The acceptance rate is anticipated to be similar to that of
  past years (around 22%-25%), subject to the decisions resulting from
  the review process. After initial notification of review results,
  conditionally accepted papers (including supplemental material) will
  undergo a revision and review cycle in order to ensure that they are
  acceptable for publication and presentation in the journal. The
  paper and supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE
  Digital Library, subject to its standard terms and conditions.

* **Conference-only Track**: Top quality and timely, innovative VAST
  submissions may be accepted for the conference-only track. Those
  papers, which feature new contributions, will be presented as
  Conference Papers during IEEE VAST, and will be included on the IEEE
  VIS USB Proceedings. After initial notification of review results,
  conditionally accepted papers (including supplemental material) will
  undergo a revision and approval cycle. The paper and supplemental
  material will be submitted to the IEEE Digital Library subject to
  its standard terms and conditions.

Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by
highly interactive visual interfaces. People use visual analytics
tools and techniques in all aspects of science, engineering, business,
and government to synthesize information into knowledge; derive
insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data; detect the
expected and discover the unexpected; provide timely, defensible, and
understandable assessments; and communicate assessments effectively
for action. The issues stimulating this body of research provide a
grand challenge in science: turning information overload into a
significant opportunity. Visual analytics requires interdisciplinary
science, going beyond traditional scientific and information
visualization to include statistics, mathematics, knowledge
representation, management and discovery technologies, cognitive and
perceptual sciences, decision sciences, and more. Your submission
should help develop and/or apply visual analytics, clearly showing an
interdisciplinary approach.

From its outset, IEEE VAST has always given great emphasis to
applications of visual analytics. While VAST 2017 seeks submissions in
all areas of visual analytics, it particularly welcomes papers that
make advances towards understanding or solving real world problems, or
that impact a particular application in a significant way. A strong
application paper, for which technique novelty is not essential,
typically features one of the following qualities: namely high or
broad impact, novel application, innovative technical adaptation or
integration, or insightful experience or evaluation. For further
discussion of application papers, see the VAST paper types below.

## Topics

Suggested topics for papers include, but are not limited to:

* Visual representations and interaction techniques including the
  principles for depicting information, new visual paradigms,
  statistical graphics, geospatial visualizations, the science of
  interaction, and approaches for generating visual analytic
  visualization and interactions.
* Data management and knowledge representation including scalable data
  representations for high volume and stream data, statistical and
  semantic signatures, and synthesis of information from diverse data
  sources.
* Mathematical foundations and algorithms for data transformations to
  allow interactive visual analysis.
* Analytical reasoning including the human analytic discourse,
  knowledge discovery methods, perception and cognition, and
  collaborative visual analytics
* Presentation, production, and dissemination methods including
  methods and tools for capturing the analytics process, methods for
  elicitation of stakeholder constraints, priorities & processes for
  incorporation in analysis, and storytelling for specific and varying
  audiences.
* Applications of visual analysis techniques, including but not
  limited to applications in science, engineering, humanities,
  business, public safety, commerce, and logistics as far as they
  contribute to visual analytics are of particular interest.
* Evaluation methods, visual ethical analysis such as privacy,
  security, & regulatory compliance, interoperability, and technology
  practice & experience.
* Discourse visualization and visual representations of the reasoning
  process.
* Algorithms and technologies which are fundamental for visual
  analytics, including user and device adaptivity, web interfaces and
  mobile or other novel devices.
  
Please note that topics primarily involving spatial data (such as
scalar, vector and tensor fields) might be a better match for SciVis:
the IEEE Conference on Scientific Visualization at IEEE
VIS. Similarly, topics which clearly focus on information
visualization, e.g., graphical representation of abstract data to aid
cognition, might be a better match for the IEEE InfoVis Conference,
also at IEEE VIS. Papers chairs reserve the right to move papers
between conferences based on its topic and perceived fit.

## Paper Types

VAST has two tracks, TVCG and Conference-only tracks, which correspond
to different levels of originality, rigor, and significance. In
general, VAST papers should be written, submitted and reviewed in the
same way as papers at the other two VIS conferences (i.e., InfoVis and
SciVis), following the detailed submission guidelines. However, with
the rapid development of the science, technology and application of
visual analytics, it is sensible to adjust our understanding of VAST
publications from time to time. We provide the following
clarifications about paper types for VAST 2016, beyond the discussion
of the five paper types in the shared guidelines.

In visual analytics, concepts, theories, algorithms, techniques,
designs, systems, empirical studies and applications normally create a
context where analysis, visualization and interaction are integrated
to optimize the combination of human and machine capabilities. It is
this context that differentiates VAST from other conferences in VIS,
while data involved can be spatial or non-spatial, techniques can be
human-centric or machine-centric, and the application domain can be
almost any academic discipline, industry, business sector, or
governmental operation. Within such a context, an individual VAST
paper may give a strong focus on an aspect where novel contributions
reside, or place its emphasis on the integration of different aspects.

VAST papers typically fall into one of these six categories:

* Theory and Model
* Technique and Algorithm
* Design Study
* Empirical Study (referred to as the Evaluation type in in the shared guidelines)
* System
* Application (as a separate category from the Design Study type in the shared guidelines)

### Theory and Model

* Fundamentals of visual analytics.
* Conceptual understanding and modelling of visual analytics (e.g.,
  definitions, taxonomies, analytic frameworks, and research methods,
  etc.).
* Philosophical and sociological discourses of visual analytics (e.g.,
  human vs machine, ethics, data security, uncertainty, biases, and
  privacy, etc.)
* Perception and cognition in visual analytics.
* Mathematical abstraction and modelling of visual analytics processes.
* Concepts and models that govern quality metrics and benchmarks for
  evaluating visual analytics processes and systems.

**Multi-type Papers**. It is important to note that a VAST paper can present a mixture of contributions that fall into different categories. For example, a new technique may be presented in conjunction with an important application; a new design study may be led by an empirical study and supported by qualitative evaluation; a theoretical model may be supported by evidence from a real world application; and so forth. We encourage reviewers to appreciate the combined values of the mixed contributions rather than shoehorning such a paper into a specific category. Authors are encouraged to explicitly state the contributions made by their paper to all involved categories of research.

**Authors' Perspective**. The VIS guidelines, together with cited papers and reports, provide authors, especially less experienced authors, with useful guidance to organize their research activities and structure papers. Even experienced authors should not overlook such guidelines.

**Reviewers' Perspective**. Meanwhile, since VAST research usually features innovation, creativity and cross-disciplinarity, reviewers should not use these guidelines as a check list for acceptance or rejection in a simplistic manner. The goal of the review process is to bring the most exciting or important advances in areas of visual analytics to the VIS attendees, TVCG readers, and the larger community. Hence the role of a reviewer should be closer to a judge for a talent show than a hygiene inspector.

Reviewing is essentially an evaluation process with reviews intended to offer a balanced assessment of originality, rigor, and significance. For VAST, we particularly welcome papers that excel in at least one of these three aspects while being adequate in others. We equally welcome papers that feature significant impact on visual analytics applications, and/or interdisciplinary research activities (e.g., machine learning, cognitive sciences, and so on). Reviewers are encouraged to appraise positively Application papers and Empirical Study papers that feature such qualities.
