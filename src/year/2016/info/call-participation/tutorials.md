Tutorials are intended to cover a wide selection of topics related to
IEEE VIS 2016 and provide background on new tools and application
domains necessary for research in data and information visualization
and visual analytics. Tutorial attendees come from diverse
backgrounds, including volume visualization and rendering, information
visualization, geographic visualization, visual analytics, high
performance computing, and scientific application communities.

We are soliciting half-day tutorial proposals in the areas of visualization systems, mathematical foundations, research methods, design and development methodology, and application areas. We welcome new tools and techniques for visualization, domains in which visualization applies, methods for undertaking visualization research, as well as proposals on more traditional visualization topics. Topics can include--but are not limited to--any of those listed in the calls for papers for VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis. Tutorials with an application focus and including hands-on demos are also encouraged.

### TUTORIAL DETAILS

Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the tutorial's importance
and suitability for presentation in a tutorial format, the past
experience and qualifications of the instructors, the overall balance
in the tutorial program, and the likely attendance of the
tutorial. Repeat tutorial proposals should note in which years
identical or similar tutorials have been presented, and will be judged
in part by the attendance of the previous versions.

All tutorial proposals should include:

* The level of the tutorial (beginning, intermediate, or advanced)
* An abstract of the tutorial topic
* A description of the tutorial's organization including time
  allocation and outline for major course topics (500 word minimum)
* The background and contact information for each instructor.

Proposals should not exceed three pages, and should be
[submitted via PCS](http://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/). Please
note the
[formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html)
when preparing your submission. Authors of accepted tutorials are
required to prepare a short summary for the printed program (~50
words) and are strongly encouraged to submit a Video Preview.
