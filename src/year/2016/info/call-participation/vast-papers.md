The **IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (IEEE
VAST 2016)** is the leading international conference dedicated to
advances in visual analytics. The scope of the conference, co-located
at VIS with the annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference and
the IEEE Information Visualization Conference, includes both
fundamental research contributions within visual analytics as well as
applications of visual analytics in science, engineering, medicine,
health, media, business, social interaction, security and
investigative analysis, and other disciplines. We invite you to
participate in IEEE VAST 2016 by submitting your original research and
application papers.

Following the successful two-track arrangement in the previous years,
IEEE VAST 2016 will again feature an expanded set of accepted papers
in two categories:

* **<em>TVCG</em> Track**
  
  Papers that exhibit the highest quality in terms of originality,
  rigor and significance will appear in a special issue of the IEEE
  Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). This
  journal special issue will have the publication date of January 2017
  and will be published online the first day of the conference
  (October 25, 2016); individual paper preprints will be available for
  online Early Access by September 1, 2016. The acceptance rate is
  anticipated to be similar to that of 2014 and 2015 (around 22%-25%)
  subject to the decisions resulting from the review process. After
  initial notification of review results, conditionally accepted
  papers (including supplemental material) will undergo a revision and
  review cycle in order to ensure that they are acceptable for
  publication and presentation in the journal. The paper and
  supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE Digital
  Library, subject to its standard terms and conditions

* **Conference-only Track**
  
  Innovative VAST submissions with a focus beyond the scope of the
  IEEE TVCG journal may be accepted as conference only papers. Those
  papers, which feature high quality new contributions, will be
  offered an opportunity to be presented as Conference Papers during
  IEEE VAST, and will be included on the IEEE VIS 2016 USB. After
  initial notification of review results, conditionally accepted
  papers (including supplemental material) will undergo a revision and
  approval cycle. The paper and supplemental material will be
  submitted to the IEEE Digital Library subject to its standard terms
  and conditions

Visual Analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by
highly interactive visual interfaces. People use visual analytics
tools and techniques in all aspects of science, engineering, business,
and government to synthesize information into knowledge; derive
insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data; detect the
expected and discover the unexpected; provide timely, defensible, and
understandable assessments; and communicate assessments effectively
for action. The issues stimulating this body of research provide a
grand challenge in science: turning information overload into a
significant opportunity. Visual analytics requires interdisciplinary
science, going beyond traditional scientific and information
visualization to include statistics, mathematics, knowledge
representation, management and discovery technologies, cognitive and
perceptual sciences, decision sciences, and more. Your submission
should help develop and/or apply visual analytics, clearly showing an
interdisciplinary approach.

From its outset, IEEE VAST has always given great emphasis to
applications of visual analytics. While VAST 2016 seeks submissions in
all areas of visual analytics, it particularly welcomes papers that
make advances towards understanding or solving real world problems, or
that impact a particular application in a significant way. A strong
application paper, for which technique novelty is not essential,
typically features one of the following qualities: namely high or
broad impact, novel application, innovative technical adaptation or
integration, or insightful experience or evaluation. For further
discussion of application papers see the
[VAST paper types page](/year/2016/info/call-participation/vast-paper-types).

### SUBMISSION

All three conferences at IEEE VIS 2016 (VAST, InfoVis and SciVis) use
the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle their submission and
reviewing process. PCS is available at
[https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/](https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/). When
submitting your manuscript please make sure that you submit it to your
intended conference by clicking the appropriate conference header in
the conference system landing page. If you are unsure which venue you
should submit to, you can use the call for papers on this website, as
well as last year's published proceedings, as a guideline.

### DETAILED SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully
read and adhere to the
[paper submission guidelines](/year/2016/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines).

### TOPICS

Suggested topics for papers include, but are not limited to:

* Visual representations and interaction techniques including the
  principles for depicting information, new visual paradigms,
  statistical graphics, geospatial visualizations, the science of
  interaction, and approaches for generating visual analytic
  visualization and interactions.
* Data management and knowledge representation including scalable data
  representations for high volume and stream data, statistical and
  semantic signatures, and synthesis of information from diverse data
  sources.
* Mathematical foundations and algorithms for data transformations to
  allow interactive visual analysis.
* Analytical reasoning including the human analytic discourse,
  knowledge discovery methods, perception and cognition, and
  collaborative visual analytics
* Presentation, production, and dissemination methods including
  methods and tools for capturing the analytics process, methods for
  elicitation of stakeholder constraints, priorities & processes for
  incorporation in analysis, and storytelling for specific and varying
  audiences.
* Applications of visual analysis techniques, including but not
  limited to applications in science, engineering, humanities,
  business, public safety, commerce, and logistics as far as they
  contribute to visual analytics are of particular interest.
* Evaluation methods, visual ethical analysis such as privacy,
  security, & regulatory compliance, interoperability, and technology
  practice & experience.
* Discourse visualization and visual representations of the reasoning
  process.
* Algorithms and technologies which are fundamental for visual
  analytics, including user and device adaptivity, web interfaces and
  mobile or other novel devices.
