**IEEE VIS 2016** is the premier forum for advances in visualization for
academia, government, and industry. This event brings together
researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in visualization
solutions. The **IEEE Information Visualization Conference** (InfoVis),
one of the three main conferences at VIS 2016, solicits novel research
ideas and innovative applications in all areas of information
visualization.

### JOURNAL PUBLICATION AND DATE OF PUBLICATION

Papers accepted to IEEE InfoVis will appear in a special issue of the
IEEE *Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics
(TVCG)*. This journal special issue will have the publication date of
January 2017 and will be published online the first day of the
conference (October 25, 2016); individual paper preprints will be
available for online Early Access by September 1, 2016. Papers
(including supplemental material) will undergo a revision and review
cycle after initial notification of review results in order to ensure
that they are acceptable for publication in the journal. The paper and
supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE Digital
Library, subject to its standard terms and conditions.

### SUBMISSION

All three conferences at IEEE VIS 2016 (VAST, InfoVis and SciVis) use
the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle their submission and
reviewing process. PCS is available at
[https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/](https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/). When
submitting your manuscript, please make sure that you submit it to
your intended conference by clicking the appropriate conference header
in the conference system landing page. If you are unsure which venue
you should submit to, you can use the call for papers on this website,
as well as last year's published proceedings as a guideline.

### DETAILED SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully
read and adhere to the
[paper submission guidelines](/year/2016/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines).

### TOPICS

The IEEE InfoVis conference solicits research papers on diverse topics
related to information visualization. Information visualization,
broadly defined, involves the design of visual data representations
and interaction techniques that support human activities, where the
spatial layout of the visual representation is chosen by the
designer. Papers may contribute novel visual encoding or interaction
techniques, tools and techniques to support the visual data analysis
process, evaluations of InfoVis techniques and tools, models or
taxonomies related to InfoVis, systems that support visual data
analysis, or experience applying information visualization to a
domain-specific problem. Note that none of these guidelines are in any
way prescriptive; in fact, many successful papers combine two
contribution types, and the very best papers combine several.

Please note that topics primarily involving spatial data (such as
scalar, vector and tensor fields) might be a better match for the IEEE
SciVis Conference at IEEE VIS. Similarly, topics which clearly focus
on visual analytics, e.g., the integration of computational solutions
facilitated by visual interfaces, might be a better match for the IEEE
VAST Conference, also at IEEE VIS.

Specific topics include, but are not limited to:

*Information visualization techniques* for

* graphs, trees, and other relational data
* high-dimensional data and dimensionality reduction
* multivariate data and heterogeneous data
* personal or social data (health, energy, finance, email, etc.)
* text and documents
* non-numeric data (categorical data, nominal data, etc.)
* non-expert audiences
* causality and uncertainty data
* time-series data
* any other non-spatial data
* spatial data that is visualized with a new spatial mapping
* streaming or time-varying data
* very large data sets (scalability)

*Techniques for interacting with visualizations or supporting the
  data analysis process, including*

* recordkeeping, sensemaking, and storytelling
* collaboration support, either co-located or distributed
* integration of visualization with other software tools
* post-WIMP interactions (pen, touch, speech, gestures, etc.)
* focus + context and overview + detail methods
* zooming, navigation, and distortion techniques
* brushing and linking
* coordinated multiple views
* data labeling, editing, and annotation

*Integration of visualizations into the context of use, including*

* visual design and aesthetics
* minimal attention contexts, e.g. ambient displays
* mobile and ubiquitous
* public environments

*Information visualization fundamentals and methodologies*

* visualization systems
* novel algorithms and mathematics
* taxonomies and models
* research methodology, discussions, and frameworks
* cognition and perception issues

*Evaluation*

* task and requirements analysis
* metrics and benchmarks
* qualitative and quantitative evaluation
* laboratory and field studies
* novel evaluation methods
* usability studies and focus groups
* case studies

*Applied information visualization*

* reports of information visualization in domains where it has impact
* using information visualization for education and teaching
* design studies
