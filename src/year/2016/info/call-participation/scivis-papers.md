**IEEE VIS 2016** is the premier forum for advances in visualization
for academia, government, and industry. This event brings together
researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in visualization
techniques, tools, and technology. The **IEEE Scientific Visualization
(SciVis) Conference** solicits novel research ideas and innovative
applications in all areas of scientific visualization.

Papers accepted to IEEE SciVis will appear in a special issue of the
IEEE *Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)*. This
special issue will be published online the first day of the
conference. The acceptance rate is anticipated to be similar to that
of 2014 and 2015 subject to the decisions resulting from the review
process. After initial notification of review results, conditionally
accepted papers (including supplemental material) will undergo a
revision and review cycle in order to ensure that they are acceptable
for publication and presentation in the journal. The paper and
supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE Digital
Library.

Of the paper types, IEEE SciVis has always had a strong emphasis on
technique papers. While SciVis 2016 seeks submissions in all areas of
scientific visualization, it particularly welcomes papers that give
emphasis to systems for (system paper type) and applications of
(application paper type) scientific visualization. In particular,
papers that make advances towards understanding or solving real world
problems, or that impact a particular application in a significant way
are welcome.

### SUBMISSION

All three conferences appearing at IEEE VIS 2016 (VAST, InfoVis, and
SciVis) use the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle their
submission and reviewing process. PCS is available at
[https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/](https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/). When
submitting your manuscript please make sure that you submit it to your
intended conference by clicking the appropriate conference header in
the conference system landing page. If you are unsure which venue you
should submit to, you can use the call for papers on this website, as
well as last year's published proceedings as a guideline.

### DETAILED SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully
read and adhere to the
[submission guidelines](/year/2016/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines).

### TOPICS

The IEEE Scientific Visualization conference is soliciting papers on
all topics in visualization and visual computing research. Besides the
traditional scientific visualization research areas, we encourage
submissions from related areas such as visual computing, machine
learning, data analytics, data sciences etc. that will broaden the
foundation of scientific visualization. We also welcome papers that
showcase novel use of scientific visualization across the full range
of application domains.

Suggested topics for papers include, but are not limited to:

* *Visualization, rendering, and manipulation of spatial data*. Scalar,
  vector and tensor fields, flow fields, regular and unstructured
  grids, point-based data, temporal data, volumetric data,
  topology-based and geometry-based techniques, PDEs, time-varying
  data, multidimensional multi-field, multi-modal, and multivariate
  data, streaming data, multi-resolution, compression.
* *Interaction techniques and devices*. User interfaces, interaction
  design, coordinated and multiple views, data editing for validation,
  manipulation and deformation, multimodal input devices, haptics for
  visualization, mobile and ubiquitous visualization, visual
  interaction for data science, interaction with visualizations in
  different display environments.
* *Data science*. Large-scale computing, storage and data analytics,
  distributed, cluster, and grid computing, scalable data management
  on and off the cloud, high-performance computing on multi-core,
  GPUs, FPGA, and embedded devices, information extraction and
  knowledge discovery from big data, petascale visualization,
  application of computer vision techniques, statistical modeling,
  data mining, machine learning, clustering techniques, reduced-order
  modeling, visual steering for data retrieval.
* *Display technologies*. Large and high-res displays, giga-pixel
  displays, wrist-displays, stereo displays, immersive and virtual
  environments, mixed and augmented visualization, projector-camera
  systems, perception and cognition coupled displays.
* *Foundations*.  Collaborative and distributed visualization, visual
  design and design studies, mathematical theories for visualization,
  scalability issues, uncertainty visualization, visualization
  verification, view-dependent visualization, information theoretic
  approaches, perception theory, color, texture, scene and motion
  perception, knowledge-assisted visualization.
* *Evaluation*.  Usability studies and task analysis, design and user
  studies, validation and verification visualization, statistical
  techniques, crowd-sourcing, human computation.
* *Visual computing systems and methodologies*. System and toolkit
  design, glyph-based techniques, illustrative visualization,

  of visual analytics approaches, computational steering.
* *Visual computing applications*.  Mathematics, physical sciences and
  engineering, earth, space, and environmental sciences, flow fields,
  terrain visualization, geographic/geospatial visualization,
  molecular, biomedical and medical visualization, bioinformatics
  visualization, software visualization, business and finance

  humanities, for the masses, multimedia (image/video/music).
* *Visual computing for emerging applications*.  Nano-assembly, live
  cell imaging, imaging genetics, micro-biology, robotics, sensor
  networks, cybersecurity, urban science, computational architecture
  and others.
