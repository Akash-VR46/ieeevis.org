<td colspan="2"><h3>Visualizing knowhow, technological diffusion and
the wealth of nations</h3>
<p>Recent theories of the wealth and poverty of nations put the accent
on the accumulation of collective knowhow. The fundamental difference
between rich and poor countries is not in the average level of
individual skills of their citizens but in the kinds of things that
can be done collectively. This creates an important visualization
problem: how to measure and represent the differential levels of
collective knowhow between countries and regions? How to visualize its
evolution in time?  How to identify more feasible and effective paths
for progress? How can visualization help orient the efforts of the
public and private sectors in enhancing progress? </p>
