<p><strong>The three laws of communication</strong><br /> <br /> 
Useful as each of them can be, a large body of tips and tricks is impossible to remember, at least in a practical, usable way, unless it is structured into a balanced, meaningful hierarchy. This talk proposes and illustrates three simple yet solid ideas that lead to more effective communication and that underpin every other guideline: easy to remember, readily applicable, and always relevant—in short, valuable for the rest of your life.</p>
