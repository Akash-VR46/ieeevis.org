#### VIP - Transitioning Research into Re-useable Open Source or Commercial Software

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25TH  
2:00PM-3:40PM  
Location: Holiday 6

Organizer: Alan Keahey  
Panelists: Jeff Baumes, Hank Childs, Jock MacKinlay, Dan Rope, John Stasko

What are the key factors that determine whether results from the visualization research community will attain significance in practical usage? This panel will explore success stories in transitioning visualization research into more widely used systems.  The panelists represent a cross section of visualization specializations (infovis, visual analytics, media and scivis).

#### On the Death of Scientific Visualization 

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26TH  
10:30AM-12:10PM  
Location: Key 1+2+5

Organizer: Bob Laramee  
Panelists: Mike Kirby, David Laidlaw, Klaus Mueller, Han-Wei Shen, Anders Ynnerman

While InfoVis and VAST have been expanding for the last decade, SciVis seems to be, in general, contracting. This apparent contraction coincides roughly with Bill Lorenson's famous paper on the Death of Visualization. This panel discusses what appears to be a trend of the SciVis track of the conference contracting. This panel addresses some very challenging, core, fundamental questions.

#### How data visualization and regulation meet on the modern web

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26TH  
2:00PM-3:40PM  
Location: Holiday 6

Organizer: Georges Grinstein  
Panelists: Robert Baker, Betsy Beaumon, Karl Groves, Mike Paciello, Joss Stubblefield

Individuals with accessibility issues are not able to access much of our work in visualization and we, as a community, have not paid a great deal of attention to that community. This panel will address the misconceptions, the law, and the steps that need to be taken to resolve this.

#### How can we improve empirical research on understanding visual information?

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27TH  
10:30AM-12:10PM  
Location: Key 3+4+6

Organizer: Steve Haroz  
Panelists: Pierre Dragicevic, Ronald Rensink, Jessica Hullman, Matthew Kay

Empirical scientific research comprises many stages, including choosing research questions, designing experiments, analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and effectively communicating the entire process. This panel will discuss various approaches to these stages and debate how empirical research in visualization can improve.

#### Application Papers: What are they and how should they be evaluated?

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27TH  
2:00PM-3:40PM  
Location: Key 1+2+5

Organizer: Gunther Weber  
Panelists: Sheelagh Carpendale, David Ebert, Brian Fisher, Hans Hagen, Ben Shneiderman, Anders Ynnerman

This panel will start a discussion in the community about what goals an application paper ought to have, what its main contributions to the state of art of visualization should be, and how it ought to be evaluated by reviewers. How do we as a community generate clear evaluation criteria for this type of paper?

#### Pathways for Theoretical Advances in Visualization

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27TH  
4:15PM-5:55PM  
Location: Holiday 6

Organizer: Min Chen  
Panelists: Georges Grinstein, Chris Johnson, Jessie Kennedy, Tamara Munzner, Melanie Tory

This panel focuses on the question "How can we build a theoretic foundation for visualization collectively as a community?" The panellists will envision the pathways in four different aspects of a theoretic foundation, namely (i) taxonomies and ontologies, (ii) principles and guidelines, (iii) conceptual models and theoretic frameworks, and (iv) quantitative laws and theoretic systems.

#### Critical Visualization

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28TH  
8:30AM-10:10AM  
Location: Holiday 6

Organizer: Angus Forbes  
Panelists: Marian DÃ¶rk, Jessica Hullman, Dietmar Offenhuber, Adam Trowbridge, Jessica Westbrook


How could a critical approach to visualization promote disclosure,
plurality, contingency, and empowerment? What opportunities are there
for incorporating human-centered inquiry into visualization research?
Does articulating value, bias, and ideology have a place in scientific
discourse? The Critical Visualization panel will introduce the diverse
work of the four panelists and provide a forum for discussing critical
approaches to visualization.
