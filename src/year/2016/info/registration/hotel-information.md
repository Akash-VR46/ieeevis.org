In 2016, IEEE VIS returns to the city of Baltimore, Maryland, USA, for
the conference's 27th year. The conference will be located at the
Hilton Baltimore Hotel, connected to the Baltimore Convention Center.

Hilton Baltimore Hotel holds a prime place in the Inner Harbor, next door
to Camden Yards and across the street from M&T Stadium.  Baltimore's Inner
Harbor is a hub of activity. In just a few city blocks, you can unearth
dinosaurs at the Maryland Science Center, get a history lesson at the
Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, pay
respects to pop culture at Geppi's Entertainment Museum, or submerge
yourself in exotic sealife at the National Aquarium. Other attractions
include the American Visionary Art Museum, the Babe Ruth Museum, and the
Port Discovery Children's Museum.

Baltimore's Inner Harbor has loads of restaurants, pubs, hotels and shops,
many of them at the popular Harborplace shopping and entertainment center
just steps from the Hilton.  The Water Taxi at the Inner Harbor can also
take you to surrounding neighborhoods, and the free Charm City Circulator
provides daily bus service through several downtown routes.

From family-friendly museums and restaurants to satisfy every palate, to
exciting nightlife, cultural experiences and spectacular people-watching,
Baltimore's Inner Harbor offers more to see and do than you can
imagine.

The conference rate is $229/night plus 15.5% tax for single or double
occupancy rooms. The cutoff date for reservations under this rate is
September 28, 2016, at 5PM EDT. In order to make a reservation at the
