## Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria
As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative 
contributions. Submissions will be judged on their importance, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, 
appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. Papers and any supplemental material are only conditionally accepted 
and will undergo a full revision and review cycle after initial notification of review results. 
During this time, reviewers will ensure that necessary conditions for acceptance have been met in the new revision.

Additionally, IEEE VIS 2020 will feature a separate, short papers track with a submission deadline after notifications for full papers have been sent out. 
You can find out more in the call for participation for short papers on the IEEE VIS Website in the near future.
When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the [paper submission guidelines](paper-submission-guidelines).

The three conference tracks at IEEE VIS 2020 use the same submission and review process. The conferences differ in the topics, 
emphasis, and approach, as described in the conference-specific for [VAST](vast-paper-types), [InfoVis](infovis-paper-types), and [SciVis](scivis-paper-types).

Reviewers should be familiar with the [guidelines for reviewing papers for VIS](review-instructions).

Authors of accepted papers should also follow the [instructions for preparing a camera-ready submission](/year/2020/info/presenter-information/final-information-paper-authors).

## Open Access Policy
Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open access repository, please see the [VIS Open Practices Guidelines](/year/2019/info/open-practices/open-practices).
