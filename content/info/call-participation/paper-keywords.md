At VIS 2019, the VEC and the V-I-S Steering Committees adopted a proposal by the reVISe committee to replace the current PCS keywords with a new set of keywords to improve the reviewing process. 

The motivation for this change, as well as a preliminary brief overview of the new keywords can be found in the reVISe Amended Proposal.

An more comprehensive explanatory set of pages is currently under preparation. Please check back when the PCS submissions open.

The following are the categories of keywords and their descriptions:
