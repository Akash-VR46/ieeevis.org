At VIS 2019, the VEC and the V-I-S Steering Committees adopted a proposal by the reVISe committee to replace the current PCS keywords with a new set of keywords to improve the reviewing process. 

The motivation for this change, as well as a preliminary brief overview of the new keywords can be found in the reVISe Amended Proposal.

An more comprehensive explanatory set of pages is currently under preparation. Please check back when the PCS submissions open.

The following are the categories of keywords and their descriptions:

## Data Types and Their Use in Visualization and Visual Analytics
* **Geospatial Data** (Geospatial): data with geospatial (lat/lon) locations or trajectories
* **Graph/Network and Tree Data** (Network): data with network (node/link) or tree/hierarchy structure
* **High-dimensional Data** (HD): data with a large number of dimension columns (features/attributes) that requires extra effort to process
*	**Data Models** (Models): the structure of statistical and simulation models, model results and outputs, and the parameter spaces of model inputs as for example in machine learning
*	**Scalar Field Data** (Scalar): spatial/volume data with one or more scalar variables 
* **Image and Video Data** (ImageVideo): imagery data in the form of stills or video
*	**Tabular Data** (Tabular):	tables of row/column data with a moderate number of columns that are directly represented
* **Temporal Data** (Time):	data that has a temporal component (e.g. time series, time-oriented data, events, time-varying data, trajectories over time...)
*	**Text/Document Data** (Text):	data in the form of text or documents
*	**Vector and Tensor Field Data** (Vector_Tensor):	spatial data containing vector and tensor fields
* **Other Data** (OtherData): a data type that does not reasonably fit into any other category
* **DataType Agnostic** (NAData):	no special expertise on data types is required for my paper
