The IEEE VIS 2020 Poster Program offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work  or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the plagiarism statement in the end) through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

**New this year**, is the presentation of posters on touchscreen monitors. The new electronic poster presentation format allows for a richer representation of visualization research, while preserving the one-to-one dialog with the audience.


In addition to a poster being electronically displayed throughout IEEE VIS:

* a two-page summary of your work will be included in the electronic conference proceedings;
* interactive poster sessions will provide a forum for presenting your work and discussing new ideas with your peers;
* electronic posters will be available on the conference website and on electronic poster boards on site 
* one presenter per poster will be eligible for the reduced conference rate for authors.

Examples of appropriate visualization work include, but are not limited to:

* research exploring new problems or areas,
* results of pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known datasets,
* work-in-progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community,
* the application of visualization techniques to
  specific application areas, and 
* highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue.

We particularly encourage contributions that take advantage of the electronic and interactive nature of the poster space and forum to present and raise awareness of the work in effective and imaginative ways. 

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page summary of their work in the VGTC conference two-column format in line with the [IEEE VIS Posters’ formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Track/vis.html), using the poster format.

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations should be included.

Authors whose posters are accepted for IEEE VIS will be asked to refine their two-page summaries based upon feedback from reviewers and submit an electronic poster. 

The electronic posters themselves have to be created using a provided web-based interface. Access to this interface will be granted after the two-page summary has been accepted for presentation.  

Presenters are also encouraged to submit an accompanying video or other supplementary materials by following the IEEE VIS formatting guidelines: <http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/supplement.html>.

Visit the [Posters FAQ](posters-faq) page for some useful tips for authors.

### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All IEEE VIS poster submissions should be made through a single submission category on PCS - IEEE VIS Poster.

After logging into PCS at [https://new.precisionconference.com/~vgtc/](https://new.precisionconference.com/~vgtc/), start your submission by selecting "IEEE VIS Posters 2020", and then select the conference to which you are submitting a poster:

* Visual Analytics Science and Technologies (VAST) - for conference
  themes see [IEEE VAST 2020 – Topics and Paper Types](vast-paper-types)
* Information Visualization (InfoVis) - for conference themes see 
  [IEEE InfoVis 2020 – Topics and Paper Types](infovis-paper-types)
* Scientific Visualization (SciVis) - for conference themes see 
  [IEEE SciVis 2020 – Topics and Paper Types](scivis-paper-types)

### Plagiarism
All submissions must be either: 1) original work that has not been presented previously at any workshop, symposium, or conference, and not published previously in any archived conference proceeding, magazine, or journal; or 2) a summary that highlights work presented or published in a related venue with a clear statement of attribution to the original work.
At the time of submission, it is required by the authors to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work by the authors themselves, or is a summary of previously presented/published work with clear attribution. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and will lead to a removal of the submission from the review process. For more information, please see the IEEE plagiarism FAQ and the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual.

### POSTER SESSIONS

There will be multiple poster presentation sessions throughout the week for which individual posters will be scheduled. During these times, one or more authors have to be available at the electronic poster to discuss their work.


### POSTER REVIEW PROCESS

Each poster submission will be read and evaluated by at least two reviewers.

All authors will receive reviews of their submission explaining the decision and providing feedback. Authors of posters that are accepted, are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to final submission.

### BEST POSTER RESEARCH AWARDS 

The ‘Best Poster Research’ awards will recognize the most significant research contributions based on the submitted two-page poster summary. These awards will be noted in the program and presented with a signed certificate. 

### BEST POSTER DESIGN AWARDS

One poster from each conference will be awarded for ‘Best Poster Design’, which recognizes exemplary use of the electronic poster medium to communicate about their research. This will be judged based on the clarity and design of the poster displayed at the conference. Authors of awarded posters will receive a signed certificate to display with their poster at the event.
