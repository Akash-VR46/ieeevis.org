Tutorials are intended to cover a wide selection of topics related to IEEE VIS 2020 and provide background on new tools, methods, systems, and application domains necessary for research in scientific visualization, information visualization, visual analytics, and topics that span multiple of these areas. Tutorial attendees come from diverse backgrounds, including, among others: volume and flow visualization, information visualization, geographic visualization, visual analytics, high performance computing, visual data science, and scientific application communities.

We are soliciting half-day tutorial proposals in the areas of visualization systems, mathematical foundations, research methods, design and development methodology, and application areas. Topics can include–but are not limited to–any of those listed in the calls for papers for
[VAST](/year/2020/info/call-participation/vast-paper-types), 
[InfoVis](/year/2020/info/call-participation/infovis-paper-types), and 
[SciVis](/year/2020/info/call-participation/scivis-paper-types).
Tutorials with an application focus and including hands-on demos are also encouraged. Successful proposals will receive up to 2 complimentary full week conference registrations for tutorial presenters.

## Details

Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the tutorial’s fit to VIS topics and suitability for presentation in a tutorial format, the past experience and qualifications of the instructors, the overall balance in the tutorial program, and the likely attendance of the tutorial. Repeated tutorial proposals should note in which years identical or similar tutorials have been presented, and will be judged in part by the attendance of the previous versions.

All tutorial proposals should include:

* The level of background knowledge assumed by the tutorial (beginning, intermediate, or advanced);
* An abstract of the tutorial topic;
* A description of the tutorial’s organization including time allocation and outline for major course topics (500 words minimum);
* The background and contact information for each instructor.

Proposals should not exceed three pages, and should be [submitted via PCS](http://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc/). Please note the [formatting guidelines](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) when preparing your submission. Authors of accepted tutorials are required to prepare a short summary for the printed program (~50 words).
