## Review Assignment Phase

The paper submission deadline is March 31st. After paper submissions, the paper chairs assign primary and secondary reviewers, with an internal deadline of April 13th for assignments. 

Once a primary and secondary are assigned, they undertake a series of duties.

Both primaries and secondaries:
* Recruit ONE tertiary reviewer. Make certain that this external reviewer is NOT from the same institution/group as any of the other reviewers. The list of available reviewers and their interests that you can generate through PCS may be an aid to jog your memory, but note that it must be used with care and caution: it is uncurated, and thus may suggest reviewers unsuitable for a specific paper as well as lack important ones. Consider the mix of expertise and experience across all four reviewers, including junior vs. senior, male vs. female, practitioner vs. researcher, industry vs. academia, etc. We aim for a good mix of perspectives.

* NOTE: Each primary and secondary invites ONE external reviewer each. In the past, primaries invited both external reviewers, but this is NO LONGER THE CASE.

* Please do not be afraid to add new qualified reviewers that are not in the PCS database using the "register new person" mechanism. We are always looking for the top experts in a specific topic, and extending the database will benefit others as well.

* Follow up with the tertiary reviewer and ensure that they accept the invitation. If they decline or do not respond in a timely manner, please find a replacement as soon as possible.

* Please do not ask other PC members to be tertiary reviewers. The full PC list can be found on the conference website: NEED TO ADD PAGE


## Reviewing Phase 

This phase completes by May 8, 2020 11:00 pm Pacific Time (PDT).

During this phase, both primaries and secondaries:
* Write a regular review of your assigned papers. See the ‘ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE’ below that may inform your review.

* Primaries should contact us at an early stage if they need copies of any related work that they cannot access (e.g., EuroVis submissions). We can also communicate directly with authors if there are other inquiries. The sooner this engagement occurs, the better, so please get in touch.

* As the review deadline approaches, primaries should remind external reviewers to complete their reviews on time. We will send one (1) reminder as well, a week before the deadline.


## Discussion Phase

This phase completes by May 15th, 2020 11:0pm Pacific Time (PDT).

Primaries:
* Shortly after the review deadline on May 8, initiate discussion with the other reviewers in order to reach a consensus about whether the paper should be accepted or rejected for publication.

* Ensure that all reviewers contribute to the discussion about the paper. Consider emailing tertiary reviewers directly if they are not responsive.

* Write a summary review with a recommendation of acceptance or rejection based on the reviews and the discussion. If you and the secondary reviewer cannot agree on a recommendation for a submission, please document the discussion in the confidential portion of the summary review. If views have changed or consensus cannot be achieved, please let us know why in the confidential comments.

Secondaries:
* Discuss with the primary reviewer to agree on a recommendation in the first review cycle.


## DECISION PHASE== (from May 15 to May 31)
Primaries and secondaries:
* Please be available electronically for discussion with the papers chairs about the papers, your recommendation, and the review process. This is particularly important if any of your review assignments are contentious or controversial. If you will not be available to field our questions, please let us know in advance.


## ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

### Paper Quality
As an IEEE VIS PC member, you are in a position to directly control the quality of the VIS papers program. The work you accept will be the papers you will see being presented at the conference in October. Make sure that you stand behind the work you recommend for acceptance! Most importantly, this means that you should only accept high-quality papers that will contribute significantly to the VIS scientific community.

However, you should also be on the lookout for bold, creative, and potentially transformative work that may significantly extend the frontier of information visualization research. While such submissions should be held to the same quality standard as all other submissions, it is expected that they may not be able to exhaustively (or perfectly) validate all of their contributions. Such papers often become easy targets for tertiary reviewers, so it is your job as a primary or secondary reviewer to use your experience and perspective to recognize them before they are summarily rejected. We do not want the conference to consist of work with the fewest flaws; we need to weigh the possible significance of the work and the degree of ambition alongside the extent to which it is described, compared, and validated.

If you have any questions in this regard about a particular paper, please either flag this in the confidential section of your review or email us directly. Your insight and ability to look beyond the surface is exactly the kind of guidance we need from an experienced PC.


### What is a minor revision?
All VIS acceptances are conditional after the first round of reviewing, after which authors will be asked to perform a minor revision on the paper. While a select few papers do not require any changes at all, this is very rare. In other words, reviewing in this round becomes one of deciding which paper will be acceptable for publication after a minor revision. No paper is perfect; rather, your job is to identify the work that will have a significant contribution to information visualization after the authors get a period of three weeks to address reviewer comments.

So, what is a minor revision? We rely on you, the program committee members, to draw on your own experience to make this judgment. Don't be close-minded, skeptical, or suspicious; be trusting and open to new ideas. Don't expect perfectionism, reward pragmatism.

Here is an incomplete list of changes suitable for a minor revision:
* Add missing related work (unless the missing work invalidates the contribution).
* Reinforce arguments or improve reasoning (unless the central argument is fundamentally flawed).
* Adapt the contribution and scope to better fit the research area (unless there is no conceivable connection to relevant topics in the area).
* Improve language, spelling, and grammar (unless poor language precludes understanding).
* Change poor visual design choices (unless they are central to the contribution).
* Correct issues with statistical tests (unless you suspect the new results will be radically different).
* Add or improve illustrations or images (unless this requires non-trivial algorithm changes or additional research).

As you can see, there are many ways to fix an imperfect paper, and countless others are possible. Keep an open mind.


### Managing Resubmission Material
As we all know, successful publication in a premier venue such as VIS sometimes takes time. It can be frustrating for authors to resubmit a rejected paper, only to have a new set of reviewers reject a paper for precisely the opposite reasons from the original rejection. To add some memory to the process, we now encourage authors to submit resubmission materials to their papers, including past versions, past reviews, and a cover letter with the authors' response and a list of changes made.

Providing resubmission material is OPTIONAL and at the authors' discretion. Even if you have reviewed a paper before, you should not penalize that paper if the authors chose not to provide resubmission material (or vice versa).

As with all supplemental material, each individual reviewer decides how to treat resubmission materials. However, we urge you to at least take a look at any resubmission material provided and write your reviews based on a full picture of the paper.


### Assigning Scores, Requesting Revisions
Remember that the numeric scores are shorthand for a recommendation. Please check the descriptions for the numbers on the reviewing form and carefully justify your recommendation in your review. Short reviews do not help the papers chairs in making their decisions.

Note that submitting a neutral/borderline rating of 3 is acceptable, even for your summary review. If you do, however, please specify the revisions that must be completed within the (short) conference review cycle for the paper to become a 'Possible Accept'.
