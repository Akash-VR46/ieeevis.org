Do you want to meet people who share the same interests with you, discuss a topic that you care about or that brings the visualization community forward, or share viewpoints and experiences to foster community building? If yes, organize a meetup!

### What is a meetup?

Meetups are an excellent forum to discuss a wide range of topics related to visualization. For example, if you are an experienced researcher or practitioner, consider submitting a proposal to share your knowledge in an informal setting with conference participants. Meetups welcome cross-disciplinary proposals and proposals that are devoted to particular discipline methods. For example, some recent meetups have included opportunities to discuss topics related to sonification to augment visualization, machine learning for big data, inclusion and diversity in visualization research, work-life balance topics, the connection between art and science, deceptive visualizations. VIS2020 is eager to expand its meetup sessions and will consider proposals given technology resources and time availability. All meetups are public and open to everyone.

This year meetups will be organized as online group meetings taking place virtually over [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us) which gives the opportunity to reach out to a wider group of participants. You can choose whether you want to organize a formal meeting or a casual gathering. Meetups will be scheduled before/after the regular paper sessions.


### What do you get?

The meetup chairs will be offering an online setup that fits your needs, finding a time slot, advertising the meetup via social media, and making sure that everything runs smoothly. Several zoom functionalities will be at your disposal including video conferencing and messaging with up to 100 participants, [(multiple) screen sharing](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000424286-Sharing-multiple-screens-simultaneously), [collaborative whiteboard](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard), and [breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Enabling-breakout-rooms).  


### What information should a meetup proposal include?

* a responsible person (name, contact information),
* a brief description of the topic to be addressed,
* prospective audience and a foreseen number of participants,

### Whom to contact and where to submit the proposals?
