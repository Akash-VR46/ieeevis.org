Do you want to meet people who share the same interests with you, discuss a topic that you care about or that brings the visualization community forward, or share viewpoints and experiences to foster community building? If yes, organize a meetup!

### What is a meetup?

Meetups are an excellent forum to discuss a wide range of topics related to visualization. For example, if you are an experienced researcher or practitioner, consider submitting a proposal to share your knowledge in an informal setting with conference participants. Meetups welcome cross-disciplinary proposals and proposals that are devoted to particular discipline methods. For example, some recent meetups have included opportunities to discuss topics related to sonification to augment visualization, machine learning for big data, inclusion and diversity in visualization research, work-life balance topics, the connection between art and science, deceptive visualizations. VIS2020 is eager to expand its meetup sessions and will consider proposals given technology resources and time availability. All meetups are public and open to everyone.

This year meetups will be taking place virtually over zoom which gives the opportunity to reach out to a wider group of participants.

### What do you get?

The meetup chairs will take care of offering an online setup that fits your needs, finding a time slot, advertising the meetup via social media, and make sure that everything runs smoothly. 
The following zoom functionality will be at your disposal: video conferencing and messaging, (multiple) screen sharing, collaborative whiteboard, and break-out rooms. 


### What information should a meetup proposal include?

* a title,
* a responsible person (name, contact information),
* a brief description of the topic to be addressed,
* prospective audience and a foreseen number of participants,
* a plan on how you will coordinate the online meeting (e.g. format, accessibility),
* preferences and constraints for meetup schedule (if applicable).

### Whom to contact and where to submit the proposals?

Submissions should be emailed to
[meetups@ieeevis.org](mailto:meetups@ieeevis.org).

### When to submit?


Submissions will be considered subject to time and technology resources availability. Early submissions will be given a priority.
