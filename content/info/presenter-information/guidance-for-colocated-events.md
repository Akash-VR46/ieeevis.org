The VIS 2020 Tech Committee will be managing streaming of your event to Youtube and
scheduling of Zoom calls for live components (e.g., question and answer sessions paper chairs and speakers,
panels, keynotes). To help us manage streaming of your event, we will need detailed information about the event’s schedule.

In general, your event will consist of playback of prerecorded videos (paper presentations or other presentations)
and live interaction for Q&A with speakers or panels. Questions will be asked
over a chat application (Youtube Chat and [Discord](https://discord.com/)) which the chair can relay to the speaker(s)
in the Zoom call. Only those answering questions or facilitating the session will be in the Zoom call,
those watching the session will view it on Youtube and interact through chat.
It is possible for some presentations to be given live, though we advise this only be done for special scenarios
(e.g., a keynote presentation, short opening or closing by the chairs).
The majority of talks and sessions should be prerecorded to avoid
potential issues impacting the event (e.g., networking, time zones, etc.).


Terminology used in this document:

- **Session Chair**: an individual who keeps presenters on time and moderates Q&A
- **Participant**: individuals who are speaking and presenting in the Zoom call
- **Watcher**: individuals viewing the event via the Youtube stream.
  Watchers can post questions through a chat application (Discord, Youtube chat) which can
  be monitored by the Session Chair and relayed to the Participants.
- **Time Slot**: A time during your event where something happens that requires Zoom and
  Youtube, e.g., a live or recorded presentation is given, an interactive panel, etc.
- **Session**: A session consists of one or more time slots, e.g., a set of paper presentations,
  a single keynote talk. Longer events may consist of multiple sessions, separated by breaks.
  Each session will have its own Youtube stream, Zoom call, and Discord channel.

## Scheduling your Event

Please fill out information for your event following the
[templates provided](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZAkXGlEoV-kynAfYJ4zjlewGtH_oTd8F3nlG7sibgys/edit?usp=sharing).
The tech committee will reach out the organizers of each event to collect this information.
All times should be in 24-hour format in the Mountain Time zone, and formatted as HHMM (H: hour, M: minute).
If you do not have the specific presentations set for each Time Slot, please provide the schedule and
Time Slots for the event so that we can begin setting things up. We can fill in the videos and speaker
information for the Time Slots when they are ready, but the sooner this information
(e.g., videos, speaker contact information, etc.) is available, the better.

For each Session in your event, we need a schedule that defines a sequence and duration of
Time Slots in the Session and what will occur in each Time Slot:

- Live Zoom presentations
- Replays of prerecorded video presentations (e.g., paper presentations, short talks)
- Question and answer or other interactions with Participants (e.g., panels, questions to paper authors)

For each Session we also need:

- The number of Participants (including the Session Chair) who will be in the Zoom call and their contact information (names and emails)

Note that Watchers do not count toward the number of Participants, as they view the stream on Youtube and interact via chat.

For each presentation (live or recorded) in a Time Slot we need:

- Presenter's name(s)
- Presenter's email(s)
- The prerecorded video to play for the presentation, if applicable.
  Presentation videos must follow the encoding and naming conventions discussed below.
- If there is a Q&A, and if so when:
  - At the end of the live/recorded talk
  - At the end of a group of talks
  - Concurrent with the talks (i.e., people interrupt a tutorial with questions)


## Presentation Videos

Prerecorded videos played during your event (e.g., paper presentations)
must be formatted and named
following the [VIS talk recording guidelines](/year/2020/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide).

- 1920x1080 resolution at 30FPS
- MPEG-4 using H.264 encoding (file extension is .mp4)
- Files must be named following the `<shortname>_<uniqueidentifier>.mp4` convention
- Each video must include an .sbv or .srt subtitles file to provide subtitles during the stream
- Each file must be associated with a specific Time Slot during your event via its unique identifier
  so that it can be played at the appropriate time

Each video provided must be named following a `<shortname>_<uniqueidentifier>.mp4` convention.
The short name is assigned to your event by the Tech Committee to help us organize your event's content,
and can be found [here for your event](/year/2020/info/presenter-information/talk-recording-guide#conference-track-and-colocated-event-short-name-prefixes).
The unique identifier is used to uniquely associate a video with a Time Slot during your event
in which it should be played. While the choice of this is up to the organizers of each event,
it must be unique! Good options are: a number corresponding to the time slot, paper submission ID (if applicable),
talk title (if unique during the event).

## Virtual Conference Webpage

The virtual VIS conference webpage will be created using [Mini-Conf](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf),
and managed by the web committee (web@ieeevis.org). If you would like, the Mini-Conf webpage can provide
a virtual conference presence for your colocated event as well, e.g., embed each
session's Youtube stream and chat channels, PDF links, calendar information, etc.
Please let the web and tech committees know if you would like your colocated
event to be hosted on the VIS conference webpage as well, or would prefer to receive the Youtube
and chat information to provide this information separately through your event's webpage.
It is also possible to do both, if you would like to include links to each session's Youtube stream on your
webpage, but also take advantage of the calendar and other features of including your
event in the main VIS virtual conference page.
Whichever option you choose, the tech committee will manage the streaming infrastructure for your
event (Youtube, Zoom, chat).

For questions or more information, please email tech@ieeevis.org.
