### Summary

The visualization of bioelectric fields has been an ongoing challenge to cardiac and neural researchers. Bioelectrical field data are heterogeneous and their interpretation often requires simultaneous interrogation of anatomical information with measured or simulated scalar, vector, and tensor fields. They may be volumetric or constrained to (obscuring) surfaces; and are usually time-dependent. To fully understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the pathology under study, it is often necessary to integrate diverse formation across multiple scales, and to quantify and visualize the uncertainty associated with the data. Unfortunately, few visualization approaches are catered to the needs, conventions, and language of the applications, leading to a lack of widespread standards and use. Addressing these visualization challenges has potentially far-reaching benefits to both the understanding and diagnosis of a number of diseases.

The 90-minute session will be split between a single 30-minute plenary talk given by Dr. Rob S. MacLeod with experience in cardiac and neural analysis and visualization to outline the challenges facing the field. The plenary talk will be followed by three 15-minute talks from specialists from across the country who will outline their specific applications and visualization challenges.

### Summary

Medical is a popular application in visualization. In this area, there are decades of development. In addition, the medical application highly contributes to the visualization research. Medicine itself is a developing area, where novel imaging, diagnosis, and treatment techniques are constantly developed and improved. Due to the increasing data complexity in this field, novel challenges arise when considering medical visualization. Still, by now fewer and fewer medical visualization contributions appear in proceedings of VIS related conferences.
In this application spotlight, we aim to summarize and discuss recent challenges and proposed solutions in the area of medical visualization. These challenges include uncertainty visualization, multi-modal visualization, teaching of medical students, challenges in publishing medical visualization papers, surgery assistance, and legal regulations that need to be considered when proposing novel visualization techniques to the medical market.

We plan to structure our application spotlight as follows. First, we intend to invite selected speakers, that are working in the field of medical visualization to obtain their opinion on recent challenges in this field. Subsequently, we aim to feature a lively discussion with the audience of our spotlight to identify additional problems. Furthermore, we aim to highlight recent problems in publishing papers in the application area of medical. This discussion will be the main part of the application spotlight and will be carefully tracked. Based on the proposed event, we aim to provide a list of current challenges in medical visualization that will be publicly available. We hope that this list of challenges provides a deeper understanding to the VIS community as to why developments in medical visualizations are in high demand and how our community can benefit from and contribute to them.

### Summary

Cosmologists use massive computer simulations to verify that models of the formation of the universe match observational data from telescopes. The massive data from these simulations create a number of opportunities for visualization, such as: 1) The Epoch of Reionization, which starts when stars first appeared after the big bang and radiation from these stars started ionizing hydrogen. This problem is similar to volume rendering but different enough that current volume rendering APIs cannot be used directly. How do we change graphics APIs to solve the reionization problem? 2) The data generated by these simulations is so large that only a few timesteps can be saved by the simulations. In post-hoc visualization, a significant amount of data wrangling is required to convert data from simulation format to something that visualization tools understand, requiring several iterations until the results are useful to the science team. Creating customizable workflows to achieve automatic visualization is an interesting research/application problem. In addition, how do we create pipelines for insitu visualization given the restrictions on memory and resources of simulation codes? 3) Validation is important in the field of cosmology, and some cosmologists compare Lagrangian cosmology simulations to Eulerian ones. How do we compare visualizations from these two different topologies? Can we assume that a point cloud volume rendering is equivalent to a grid based volume rendering?

### Summary

Industrial production is a manifold and complex process holding several substeps from product concept over prototyping to manufacturing and quality management. Here, visualization approaches can be applied in nearly each step in order to increase the quality of decision making processes. In this context, each step of the process contributes unique requirements for visualizations to be applicable. This holds several problems: first, there is no standardization for visualizations in industrial production. Second, companies and visualization researchers can follow different aims
which can make it hard to build a functional collaboration and third, there is no mechanism that keeps track of already invested or unsolved problems in visualization in industrial production.
In this application spotlight we aim to shed a light on the application of industrial production when concerning visualization tasks. We aim to bring together different actors in visualization of industrial production, such as visualization researchers, research institutes and company fellows. We aim to structure our application spotlight along the industrial production pipeline and highlight the challenges when considering visualization approaches. Furthermore, the spotlight aims to discuss the open problems and solved tasked on the boundary between visualization research and industrial
production. Here, the goal is to generate an overview over the role of visualization in industrial production, generate access for visualization researchers to this unique application and build a first step in creating a taxonomy of visualizations in industrial production.
