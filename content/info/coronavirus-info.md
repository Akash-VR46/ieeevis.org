**IEEE VIS 2020 is still scheduled to be held as planned in the Fall 2020.**

Although the main conference activities are some time away, we appreciate that some of our community might be impacted as they attempt to prepare their paper submissions.  Given our tight paper schedule, we cannot at this time shift the submission dates.  However, we are in discussions with IEEE concerning what other allowances can be made.

The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. We will continue to monitor official travel advisories related to the Coronavirus and update the event website to keep you informed. We encourage you to check back with us concerning specific travel recommendations as the conference approaches.

If you have any questions or need additional information, please email us for further details: [info(at)ieeevis.org](mailto:info@ieeevis.org)
