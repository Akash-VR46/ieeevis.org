**IEEE VIS 2020 is still scheduled to be held as planned in the Fall 2020.**

Although the main conference activities are some time away, we appreciate that some of our community might be impacted as they attempt to prepare their paper submissions. The abstract deadline remains **mandatory** and will still be 21 March 2020.  However, with COVID-19 significantly impacting research work due to restrictions on travel, meetings, etc., we are **extending** the paper deadline by two weeks (14 April 2020).  We will make the corresponding changes in the submission system within the next few days. 

Please note that by compressing the review process, we will need our community to rise up and work together in a cooperative way.  As you engage with the various IPC members, please understand the new pressures that this has introduced and respect their attempts to keep IEEE VIS 2020 moving forward while balancing being sensitive to the challenges our specific community and the broader community is facing.

The safety and well-being of all conference participants is our priority. We will continue to monitor official travel advisories related to the Coronavirus and update the event website to keep you informed. We encourage you to check back with us concerning specific travel recommendations as the conference approaches.
