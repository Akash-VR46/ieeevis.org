We hope this communication finds you and your family safe and healthy. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is currently wreaking havoc across the world, with many and often unforeseen repercussions across all of society. IEEE VIS 2020 is no exception, and the conference has already announced deadline extensions to accommodate the inevitable disruptions arising from the outbreak. Behind the scenes, the IEEE VIS organizational, papers, steering, and executive committees have been working hard to mitigate the impact of this pandemic. We---the VIS 2020 papers co-chairs---wanted to provide some advice and guidance for people still considering submitting to the conference.

First of all, please note that this statement is in no way intended to replace or override any guidelines, laws, or regulations provided by local, state, provincial, or national governments. Rather, this is our attempt to provide some helpful guidance and advice on whether and how to proceed with your research while dealing with this worldwide pandemic.

More specifically, we can think of several strategies for your research going forward:
1. **Skipping the deadline**: Everyone's physical and mental health is paramount, and the best choice may just be to not worry about submitting to IEEE VIS at all this spring;
2. **Submitting to IEEE TVCG**: You can always submit to IEEE TVCG at a later date, giving you time and space to focus on more pressing and important issues in the present;
3. **Reframing research**: Reframe your research project to avoid activities that involve in-person interaction (for those paper types for which this is necessary); and
4. **Converting to online**: Change the validation methods to include only virtual interaction with equipment and participants.

In particular, it is important to note that submitting an abstract in time for the IEEE VIS abstract deadline is *not* a commitment that you will submit a full paper by the final deadline. If you are uncertain whether or not you can finish your work, please feel free to submit an abstract now and defer the final decision until later. Furthermore, if you are uncertain whether you will be able to physically attend the conference in Salt Lake City in October, please be reassured that we will find a way for everyone's accepted papers to be presented in some virtual or prerecorded capacity.

Below we will discuss these strategies in turn, starting with the two deferred-action items---skipping and submitting to TVCG---followed by some ways to complete your work and still submit to IEEE VIS. We want to emphasize that all of these are equally valid options.

### Skipping the Deadline
First of all, we want to note that it is perfectly normal for any and all of us---authors, reviewers, and volunteers alike---to just skip the IEEE VIS 2020 deadline. There are certainly more important and pressing matters to attend to for many of our community members, including family and children, self-isolation and quarantine, and even---perish the thought---sickness and disease. We absolutely understand if this deadline is not nearly at the forefront of anyone's mind. In fact, all of us papers co-chairs are feeling the effects of the outbreak, and have been forced to make several concessions to continue our duties.
Speaking more generally, we think that 2020 will be seen as an annus horribilis for visualization research, if not scientific research in general, and we hope that our community will lower their regular expectations to weather this storm. Put differently, no one is spared from the impact of this outbreak. Your health and safety, as well as that of your family and friends, comes before any submission deadline. In other words, you should feel under no obligation to continue to work under these difficult or impossible conditions. We urge that your managers and/or advisors take this into account; in fact, if you are a manager yourself, this holds doubly true. IEEE VIS and its satellite events will still be there when you are ready to resume your regular work.

### Submitting to IEEE TVCG
As you no doubt know, many VIS papers appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics journal. For all intents and purposes, a TVCG VIS paper is indistinguishable from a normal TVCG paper. In fact, all authors of TVCG papers are given the option to present their work at the annual VIS conference if they so choose. It is basically only for historical reasons and a slightly faster review time that many people in computer science hold the actual IEEE VIS deadline in such high regard.
In practice, this means that a perfectly valid approach may just be to forget about the IEEE VIS 2020 deadline, and then submit your research to IEEE TVCG when you have been able to safely resume your work. If accepted, you will even be able to present your work at an upcoming VIS; if not in 2020, then certainly in 2021. To the best of our knowledge, accepted TVCG papers have been able to be added to the VIS program as late as during the summer prior to the conference. We are working with TVCG to push back this date as far as possible.

### Continuing Research
Having said all this, we also recognize that for some of us, continuing our research---even if in a diminished capacity---may be a way to cope and to retain a semblance of normality and hope. We are also aware that some of us are working under time-limited contracts, fellowships, or visas that require us to maintain a consistent publication record. For these reasons alone, we think it important that the IEEE VIS 2020 submission remains open so that those members of our community who want and are able to can still submit their work.

At the same time, we want to emphatically *discourage* any research involving personal interactions. Social distancing is everyone's responsibility in a global pandemic, and we cannot condone research that would break these guidelines. This likely means that any research work that involves specialized equipment that requires in-person access or activities that involve direct interaction with human participants (e.g., interviews, design studies, and user studies) should be *immediately* discontinued. We know that there is a temptation to "just finish that user study" or "just run that experiment" to complete your work, but at this point this is not only unethical, but actively dangerous and, in some places, even illegal. This holds not just for your own safety, but also for that of your students and research participants, and, by extension, that of anyone you or they will come into contact with.
We recognize that for some projects, not conducting this kind of validation or activity may mean that your submission cannot be completed. One option at this stage is simply to accept this fact and continue the work later; please see above. However, if you absolutely want to go ahead with your submission, we discuss some possibilities below.
Regardless of your chosen strategy, you may want to add some language to your paper discussing the discarded plans and the reason for not being able to complete these. Our community is a friendly one, and we are certain that your earnest motivation will not fall on deaf ears among reviewers.
Furthermore, we will be asking the international program committee (IPC) as well as external reviewers to be tolerant of unconventional or incomplete submissions. In fact, if you are a reviewer or IPC member, this is the time to prepare yourself for the fact that the submissions you will see when reviewing starts may not be as polished and complete as they would have been under normal circumstances. Please be as forgiving as you yourself would want your reviewers to be unto your own submissions.

### Reframing Research
The simplest way to complete your submission despite the COVID-19 pandemic may be to just reframe your research project so that it does not involve in-person interactions or equipment. It is up to the individual research team to determine whether and how to achieve this, but here are some strategies to consider:
* Can your user study be replaced by an application scenario or use-case example?
* Can your specialized lab equipment be replaced by commodity hardware that you can work on while adhering to social isolation?
* Can you replace video and/or photographs of your equipment or participants with stock footage?

In reframing your work, you may inevitably end up with a paper with a smaller contribution than what was previously planned. In this case, submitting to the IEEE VIS short papers (or even posters) deadline may also be an option. As an added advantage, this deadline is much later than the main papers deadline, giving you and your team more time to finish the work.

### Converting to Online
For some research studies, you may have some success making your evaluation online only. Given the maturity of today's video conferencing equipment and the ready access to crowdsourcing platforms, many research projects are in an excellent position to be converted to a virtual format. Here are some strategies to consider:
Can the specialized equipment you need for your research be accessed remotely?
Can you collect data using an online form, such as SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, or Google Forms?
Can you interview your participants using video conferencing software such as Skype, Google Hangouts, Zoom, or WebEx?
Can your participants connect to your research prototype using their web browsers?
Can your participants share their screen using video conferencing software, allowing you to observe or record them and their screen if necessary? 
Can your participants connect remotely to a research prototype installed on your own computer using remote desktop software such as VNC, TeamViewer, or AnyDesk?
Can you move your in-person user study to a crowdsourcing platform such as Prolific, Figure Eight, or Amazon Mechanical Turk?
As always, consult with your IRB (for U.S. universities) or equivalent ethics approval board to ensure that you are allowed to make such a change on short notice.

### Final Words
This is a difficult time for our community, and the choices you have in front of you are not easy. We apologize for providing all this information at such short notice before the deadline, but we are simply trying to accommodate as many potential strategies as possible. Please let us know if anything is unclear or incorrect, and we will do our best to address it.
Above all, remember to take care of yourself and yours. We will get through this, and IEEE VIS will be here when you return.
Stay safe and healthy, good luck with your submissions, regardless of the route you choose, and we sincerely hope to see you at IEEE VIS 2020 in Salt Lake City in October!

Sincerely,

The IEEE VIS 2020 papers co-chairs
