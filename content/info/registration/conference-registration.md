This year brings challenges, but also opportunities. While we are saddened by the fact that we cannot be together in Salt Lake City, we are excited by the opportunity a virtual format brings us to expand our community. To encourage new attendees and ensure maximum exposure for our various content presenters, we have made conference participation for conference attendees free while charging a fee for our content providers. 

All attendees need to register online in advance.

The early registration period for the Virtual IEEE VIS 2020 lasts until **September 30, 2020**. Afterwards the standard registration fees apply.

**To register, talk to TINA, our AI Assistant.** 

We realize that this year has impacted people in various ways â€” sometimes very disproportionately. We invite **registrants requiring support due to special circumstances** to apply for the use of the diversity and inclusivity funds and/or hardship funds (as appropriate), which may be used to offset registration costs.
If due to various hardship circumstances you are required to register due to providing a content-item but are not able to do so, you may apply for a hardship exemption. These will be decided upon by the General Chairs and the VEC chair. To apply, please submit a one page (Letter/A4) request stating the content-item and the nature of your hardship request to [fee_waiver@ieeevis.org](mailto:fee_waiver@ieeevis.org). 

Note that this year (only), the registration will be attached to content-items (e.g. papers, short papers, posters, panel organization, etc.). For each content-item presented at IEEE VIS 2020, only one author is required to register as content provider. We have created a tier system to catalog the various content-items and the associated registration costs.

This model, while imperfect, aims at making sure that we keep running a vibrant and fiscally healthy conference even during these difficult times.

**General attendees:** Free conference registration will provide access to main conference tracks, symposia, tutorials and workshops. Conference publications will be made accessible for a limited time via miniconf site.

**General attendees with conference content download :** Same benefits for general attendees, plus link to downloadable VIS 2020 conference proceedings and content.

**Content provider tier 1:** Conference attendee paying for papers published at VIS2020 through IEEE TVCG / Xplore.

**Content provider tier 2:** Conference attendee paying for other content-items such as workshop organization and presentation, tutorials, panel organization, posters, application spotlights, VisAP exhibits, invited presenters from TVCG and CG&A, etc.  

**Note to content providers:** All content providers need to register in order to sign video waiver form. A single content provider registration fee must be paid for each content-item. 


All registration fees will be charged in USD dollars.
