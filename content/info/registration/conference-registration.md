**Registration FAQs** 

**Q: The term 'content-item' was used.  What does this mean?  I have not heard this at IEEE VIS before.**
A: For this year, we are associating fees with 'content-items' and not with participants. A content-item is a paper, short paper, poster, panel organization, or presentation that is given at any VIS conference track or associated event, including all symposiums and workshops. A single registration fee must be paid for each content-item.  

**Q: Who has to register for content-items?**
A: All presenters need to register because the video consent form is part of registration.

**Q: I am a contributor to multiple content-items. Do I need to register multiple times?**
A: Not necessarily. Each content-item requires only one registration fee be paid. For example:
If paper X has authors A,B,C and poster Y has authors B,C,D:
only two paid content-item registrations are needed.
For example authors A and C may register.

**Q: How do you decide who should pay for the content-item registration?**
A: We have decided to leave this decision up to the discretion of the authors/organizers of each content-item.

**Q: I am a co-author on a paper, and a subgroup of the co-authors have decided to split the content-item registration cost.  Can this be done?  Can we get separate (split bill) receipts?**
A: Under special circumstances and with some restrictions, this may be do-able.  You should reach out to [registration@ieeevis.org](mailto:registration@ieeevis.org). .

**Q: I am the author presenting a paper. Do I need to be the one who registers for this content-item?**
A: No. Any author can register.
