This year brings challenges, but also opportunities. While we are saddened by the fact that we cannot be together in Salt Lake City, we are excited by the opportunity a virtual format brings us to expand our community. Even virtual conferences have costs, and hence registration fees are a necessity. To encourage new attendees and ensure maximum exposure for our various content presenters, we have made conference participation for conference attendees free while charging a fee for our content providers. 

We invite registrants requiring support due to special circumstances to apply for the use of the [diversity and inclusivity funds](/year/2020/info/inclusion-and-diversity/diversity-scholarship) and/or limited [fee waiver funds](#fee-waiver) (as appropriate), which may be used to offset registration costs. This model, while imperfect, aims at making sure that we keep running a vibrant and fiscally healthy conference even during these difficult times. Note that this year (only), the registration will be attached to content-items (e.g. papers, short papers, posters, panel organization, etc.). For each content-item presented at IEEE VIS 2020, only one author is required to register. We have created a tier system to catalog the various content-items and the associated registration costs. For further information, please see our [Registration FAQ](#registration-faqs).


All attendees need to register online in advance.

The early registration period for the Virtual IEEE VIS 2020 lasts until **September 30, 2020**. Afterwards the standard registration fees apply.

**To register, talk to TINA, our AI Assistant.** 

We realize that this year has impacted people in various ways — sometimes very disproportionately. We invite **registrants requiring support due to special circumstances** to apply for the use of the diversity and inclusivity funds and/or fee waiver funds (as appropriate), which may be used to offset registration costs.
If due to various hardship circumstances you are required to register due to providing a content-item but are not able to do so, you may apply for a fee waiver. These will be decided upon by the General Chairs and the VEC chair. To apply, please submit a one page (Letter/A4) request stating the content-item and the nature of your hardship request to [fee_waiver@ieeevis.org](mailto:fee_waiver@ieeevis.org). 

Note that this year (only), the registration will be attached to content-items (e.g. papers, short papers, posters, panel organization, etc.). For each content-item presented at IEEE VIS 2020, only one author is required to register as content provider. We have created a tier system to catalog the various content-items and the associated registration costs.

This model, while imperfect, aims at making sure that we keep running a vibrant and fiscally healthy conference even during these difficult times.

## Fee waiver

We realize that this year has impacted people in various ways — sometimes very disproportionately. If due to various hardship circumstances you are required to register due to providing a content-item but are not able to do so, you may apply for a fee waiver. These will be decided upon by the General Chairs and the VEC chair. To apply, please submit a one page (Letter/A4) request stating the content-item and the nature of your hardship request.  Please submit your request to [fee_waiver@ieeevis.org](mailto:fee_waiver@ieeevis.org) by *30 September for consideration*.

## Registration FAQs

**Q: The term 'content-item' was used.  What does this mean?  I have not heard this at IEEE VIS before.**
A: For this year, we are associating fees with ‘content-items’ and not with participants.  A content-item is associated with a paper, short paper, poster, panel organization, and/or workshop organization and presentation.  One content-item registration fee must be paid for a paper, short-paper and/or poster content-item.  Two content-item registration fees must be paid for a panel organization and/or workshop organization and presentation content-item.  

**Q: As a follow-up on the previous question:  is the content-item registration fee the same for papers and workshops, etc.?**
A: Papers published in the IEEE TVCG journal or IEEE Xplore require one ‘high tier’ content-item registration fee.   Panels and workshop organization require two lower-tier content-item registration fees.  Posters and workshop presentations require one ‘low tier’ content-item registration fee. For further clarifications please contact [registration@ieeevis.org](mailto:registration@ieeevis.org).

**Q: I am a contributor to multiple content-items. Do I need to register multiple times?**
A: Not necessarily. Each content-item requires only one registration fee be paid. For example:
If paper X has authors A,B,C and poster Y has authors B,C,D:
only two paid content-item registrations are needed.
For example authors A and C may register.

**Q: How do you decide who should pay for the content-item registration?**
A: We have decided to leave this decision up to the discretion of the authors/organizers of each content-item.

**Q: I am a co-author on a paper, and a subgroup of the co-authors have decided to split the content-item registration cost.  Can this be done?  Can we get separate (split bill) receipts?**
A:  Under special circumstances and with some restrictions, this may be do-able. You should reach out to [registration@ieeevis.org](mailto:registration@ieeevis.org).

**Q: I am the author presenting a paper. Do I need to be the one who registers for this content-item?**
A: No. Any author can register.
