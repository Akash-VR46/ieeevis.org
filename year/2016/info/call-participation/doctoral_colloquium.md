We solicit submissions to the doctoral colloquium (DC) for **IEEE VIS
2016**. The DC is a single-day invitation-only event taking place the
day before IEEE VIS, where Ph.D. students present their proposed
dissertation work and receive feedback from leading senior
visualization researchers. We invite contributions from the scientific
visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics student
communities.

The colloquium will allow students to discuss their research
directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished
leaders and with their peers. Students can expect helpful feedback and
fresh perspectives on their research topics and possible career paths,
and will have the opportunity to interact closely with expert
researchers in their field. The colloquium will support
community-building by connecting beginning and advanced researchers.

The DC is open to Ph.D. students at all stages of their
studies---preferably those at the proposal defense stage or
equivalent---regardless of whether they are presenting research work at
the main conference or not. Only selected applicants will be allowed
to participate in the colloquium, and will be expected to attend the
full day of events. Preference will be given to students who have
formulated a dissertation topic but are still a year or more away from
graduating. In North American terms, this corresponds to students that
will or have recently had their thesis proposal approved. Students who
are in the process of formulating their research topic are
particularly encouraged to apply, as this is the time where external
feedback can have most impact. It is our experience that students who
participate in the DC too early in their studies will not be able to
get focused and useful feedback, whereas participating too late means
that any significant feedback received will not be possible to
incorporate in the student's dissertation due to time constraints.

All research topics suitable for the IEEE SciVis, IEEE InfoVis, and
IEEE VAST main programs as well as associated workshops and symposia
are appropriate for the Doctoral Colloquium. The Doctoral Colloquium
strongly commits to achieving diversity among the student
participants, including diversity across research groups and
geographical area.

### FORMAT

The colloquium will consist of both parallel sessions of student
presentations as well as common discussions with the expert
panelists. A catered lunch and a roundtable discussion session will
give student participants the opportunity to interact more informally
with panelists.

### FUNDING

Contingent upon pending requests for external sponsorship of the VIS
DC, we may be able to partially fund the travel, conference
registration, and lodging for accepted DC student participants.

### IMPORTANT DATES

| Submission Deadline	| **Tuesday, May 10, 2016**
| Notification	| **Friday, July 1st, 2016**

All deadlines are at **5:00pm Pacific Time (PDT)**.

## SUBMISSIONS

Applicants to the Doctoral Colloquium should submit:

* A four-page summary of their thesis research, including the problem
  being addressed, methodology and plan of research, a description of
  the progress to date, and the type of input expected from DC
  panelists. The writing should be in a proposal format, in order to
  facilitate feedback from the panelists as to validity of your
  problem and the efficacy of your approach. The structure should
  follow the format used by most universities for a thesis proposal:
  an Introduction, a Related Work, Preliminary Methods, Preliminary
  Results, Proposed Work, Discussion, Questions for the Panel, and
  Conclusion. The summary should have a single author -- the student
  submitting the entry. Please distinguish clearly between work that
  has been accomplished and that which remains to be completed. As
  indicated above, the summary should identify clearly, in a separate
  section, the feedback the student expects from the panel.
* A short, signed statement (pdf or text) from the student's advisor
  supporting the student's attendance at the colloquium and confirming
  that the student is in a good position to benefit from
  participating. Note that this should NOT be a letter of
  recommendation; a brief statement of support is sufficient. The
  statement should be appended to the student submission pdf file, not
  sent via email.
* The student submission and the mandatory advisor statement should be
  submitted as a single pdf file at
  [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeedcvis16](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeedcvis16).
  Maximum file size is 20MB. No supplementary material can be
  uploaded. If necessary please include a link to the additional
  material (e.g., a video) in the main PDF file.
  
Formatting guidelines and LaTeX/Word templates can be found at [http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).

Student submissions will be peer-reviewed and selections will be made
on the basis of their contribution to the colloquium's goals, strength
of research direction, and the advisor's assessment. Accepted
submissions will be printed for colloquium participants.
