[back to Open Practices](open-practices)  

Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to post the final version of their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline (August 1st) in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations.

## Open Access Repository Criteria

In order to ensure that papers are discoverable and remain accessible long-term, authors are encouraged to post their work to an open access repository that meets the following criteria:

**1. Findable** - Research is most effectively disseminated if it can be easily searched for, especially when people do not know exactly what they are looking for. This discoverability can be critical for scholars trying to find research that they can build off of. Therefore, papers in the archive must be indexed or registered via searchable resources such as Google. Thorough metadata, such as title, author, and possibly publication information about the peer-reviewed version should also be indexed with the paper.

**2. Accessible** - Research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, there can be no cost or sign-up requirement for viewing papers on the archive.

**3. Identifiable** - For citations and references to be useful, papers must have a globally unique and persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI). Content posted to the repository must also be immutable and timestamped. Multiple versions of a paper are acceptable, as long as previous versions and timestamps are retained.

**4. Reliable** - Research should represent a permanent advancement of knowledge and understanding, so it is important that posted papers are available for perpetuity. The archive must therefore have an explicitly stated plan for long-term reliability ([example](http://help.osf.io/m/faqs/l/726460-faqs#what-if-you-run-out-of-funding-what-happens-to-my-data)) <!-- [arxiv](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/arxivpub/arXiv+Budgets+and+Reserve+Fund+Policy) -->, or it must deposit all papers in a dedicated “dark archive” such as [Portico](https://www.portico.org) or [Clockss](https://clockss.org).

These repositories are confirmed to meet all criteria:

* [http://osf.io/preprints](http://osf.io/preprints) - [walkthrough](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsNLXSDZB5MOTj0FGtPNGZ4FKSAGJ4FrtgoMZf4z-xw/edit?usp=sharing)
* [http://arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org) - [walkthrough in progress](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oth87A9mnXK_skh1zgplto4W_eXYPZHkY3DN26gWUR4/edit)
* [http://zenodo.org](http://zenodo.org)
    
If you would like to use another repository such as an institutional repository, please email an explanation of how it meets all criteria to open_practices@ieeevis.org. A personal website, lab website, or Github repository does NOT meet the criteria.

## Sharing the Open Version with VIS

After your paper is accepted and before the print deadline, PCS will have a textbox where you can enter the URL that points to the version of your paper in the open access repository. This paper should be the final “author version”. If you have any issues, please contact the open practice chairs. If you cannot share the paper on an approved open access repository, you must enter the reason instead of the URL.

  

## Is sharing the preprint compatible with IEEE’s publication policy?

Yes! Until you sign the IEEE copyright form, the paper is 100% yours, and you can post it anywhere you like. After you sign the copyright form, IEEE explicitly allows you to keep the article on an open access preprint repository. This quote comes from the [IEEE author FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/author_faq.pdf):

> **Can an author post his manuscript on a preprint server such as ArXiv?**  
> Yes. The IEEE recognizes that many authors share their unpublished
> manuscripts on public sites. Once manuscripts have been accepted for
> publication by IEEE, an author is required to post an IEEE copyright
> notice on his preprint. Upon publication, the author must replace the
> preprint with either 1) the full citation to the IEEE work with
> Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) or a link to the paper’s abstract in
> IEEE Xplore, or 2) the accepted version only (not the IEEE published
> version), including the IEEE copyright notice and full citation, with
> a link to the final, published paper in IEEE Xplore.

## Which version of the paper can I share?
Share the final version of the paper that you create after all rounds of review because it is the most scrutinized and polished. Do not share the version created by IEEE, which typically has page numbers.

After you receive the DOI from IEEE, you can add it to the repository, which adds a link to the IEEE page.  
For OSF, go to “Edit preprint” -> “Basics” -> “Peer-reviewed publication DOI”.  
For arXiv, follow these [instructions](https://arxiv.org/help/jref).

## What about Plan-S?

[Plan-S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) is an upcoming European policy requiring publicly funded research publications to be open access (available for free). However, it only relates to open access of papers via the publisher, not preprints or other open practices such as open materials, open data, or preregistration. It can, however, impact which publisher you choose.
