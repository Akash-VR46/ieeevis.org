## Mission

The Open Practice Chairs (OPCs) of VIS aim to improve the accessibility, transparency, replicability, and reproducibility of visualization research. More specifically, the chairs will work to advance the following goals:

* Open Access: To make visualization research accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public, visualization research papers will be indexed on a free-to-read, accessible, and searchable repository with long-term reliability (Tennant et al., 2016).
* Open Artifacts: To allow reviewers and readers to scrutinize and reproduce visualization research, and to allow readers to extend and apply visualization research conclusions, all artifacts created to support research conclusions will be shared . Such artifacts include but are not limited to: 
  * Code, resource files, parameters, sample datasets, and documentation needed to reproduce software, toolkits, or experiment procedures
  * Raw empirical data collected or analyzed to support a paper’s conclusions
  * Analysis code or scripts used to support a paper’s conclusions
* Transparency in exceptions: To clarify cases when sharing is infeasible (including when sharing raw qualitative data may violate subject privacy), authors who do not share all research artifacts will provide a reason.
* Transparency in decisions: To clarify distinctions between exploratory and confirmatory research, to reduce hidden flexibility in research (i.e. unreported researcher degrees of freedom), and to minimize publications bias, researchers must be educated about the impact of these issues and use approaches such as preregistration and registered reports (Brian A. Nosek & Lakens, 2014).

By working towards achieving these goals, visualization research will become more accessible, transparent, and self-correcting, and the conclusions and guidelines that result from that research will be more credible and trustworthy (Brian A. Nosek & Bar-Anan, 2012).


## Responsibilities and expectations

To facilitate accomplishing the aforementioned open practice goals, the Open Practice Chairs are expected to:
* Set a good example by ensuring that their own recent research exemplifies open practices. All papers by OPCs accepted in the past two years will be available on a reliable open access “preprint” repository. Furthermore, all artifacts (including code, raw empirical data, and other materials) needed to reproduce the methodology and analyses for those publications will be available. If such work cannot be made available, the reason will be stated in the paper or on whichever site the OPC lists their publications.
* Communicate with paper chairs, steering committees, organizing committees, and journal editors to designate and refine standards for open practices. These standards relate to the submission and reviewing process and the publication process.
* Compile guides and exemplars and organize tutorials to educate the community about how best to conduct open research.
* Annually track the current state of open practices at VIS. For details on data collection, see (Haroz, 2018)
* The Open Practice Chairs will provide guidance to protect both authors and reviewers who seek a higher standard in open practices. If concerns or questions about open practices arise during review, the OPCs will help the paper chairs by adding clarity and providing context (assuming the OPCs are not conflicted with the submission). Such cases could include an author being scrutinized for open practices by reviewers or a reviewer requesting additional research artifacts or an explanation for why such artifacts are not shared (Morey et al., 2016).


## Multi-year Plan for Improving Open Practices in Visualization Research (December 2018)

* Continue collecting statistics on open practices at VIS and in the corresponding journals to monitor progress. Because the tracks have consistently demonstrated distinct behavior, milestones for advancing requirements will be monitored individually per track. Current status at bottom
* Open Access:
  * When a track has >90% of papers shared via any means (e.g., personal website or reliable open-access repository), a policy of mandatory postprint sharing will begin the following year. Authors of accepted papers will be required to post the author copy to a reliable open access repository (see CFP for definition of reliable).
  * Tracks that have not reached that degree of openness will focus on encouragement and education for 1-2 years to facilitate a smooth transition to the requirement.
* Open Materials and Empirical Data:
  * Established policies for improving materials and empirical data sharing include the Center for Open Science’s Badges (Blohowiak et al., 2018; Kidwell et al., 2016) and the Transparency and Open Practice (TOP) guidelines (B. A. Nosek et al., 2015).
  * For 2019, there is not enough to time to implement either standard, so encouragement and education will be the goal.
  * For 2020, each track should consider implementing either the Open Science Badges (http://cos.io/badges) and/or at least level 1 (mandatory disclosure) for the data, materials, and analysis code of the TOP guidelines (http://cos.io/top).
  * The long-term goal is all papers having open practices or explicitly stating why they cannot for cases when privacy or other concerns prevent it.
* Preregistration and Registered Reports:
  * Reduce undocumented degrees of freedom which likely increase studies’ false positive rates by making preregistration more common. As preregistration (time-stamped research plan prior to data collection) has only been used in a small number of visualization research papers, education and encouragement is the primary concern until authors and reviewers are sufficiently knowledgeable to use the practice effectively.
  * Approaches to implement registered reports (review prior to data collection) will be discussed with the journal and conference publishers.
* Publishing:
  * Visualization publication venues currently have little record of open practice standards for publication. In order to implement the current standards, the Open Practice Chairs will begin discussions for how badges and the the TOP guidelines can be implemented.
* Guides and education
  * The Open Practice Chairs will begin compiling tutorials and exemplars for how to best conduct open research.
