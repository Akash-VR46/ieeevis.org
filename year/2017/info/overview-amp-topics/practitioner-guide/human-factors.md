#### Sunday

* *Workshop* - **[Immersive Analytics: Exploring Future Interaction and Visualization Technologies for Data Analytics](http://immersiveanalytics.net/)**
This workshop looks at immersive technologies (e.g., AR, VR, Mixed reality, NUIs, large displays), scenarios, theories and frameworks, collaboration, physical and tangible visualization, as well as interaction techniques.

* *Tutorial* - **[Applying Color Theory to VIS](/year/2017/info/tutorials#Applying_Color_Theory)**

#### Monday

* *Workshop* - **[DECISIVe 2017: Dealing with Cognitive Biases in Visualizations](http://decisive-workshop.dbvis.de/)** - 
The workshop explores some of the ways in which cognitive biases impact user performance. Its goal is to share ideas about practical ways to reduce or overcome these potentially harmful effects, especially in adapting the tools developers design and build.
