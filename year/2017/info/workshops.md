DSIA brings together researchers at the intersection of databases,
machine learning, and interactive visualization. These three areas
have important things to say to each other. Modern data visualization
depends on the cutting edge of both database and machine learning
research: database researchers are exploring techniques for storing
and querying massive amounts of data; machine learning techniques
provide ways to discover unexpected patterns and to automate and scale
well-defined analysis procedures. This workshop explores the idea that
the next generation of database, machine learning, and interactive
visualization systems should not be designed in isolation. For
example, machine learning techniques might recommend improved data
transformation and visual encoding decisions. Or, database query
optimizers might take advantage of perceptual constraints, while
prefetching methods reduce latency by modeling likely
interactions. This workshop seeks to increase cross-pollination
between these fields.

We make thousands of subconscious decisions daily and often apply simplified
rules or heuristics to speed up the process. Most of these are good enough,
however when there is some uncertainty we can make what appears to be
irrational decisions, leading to inaccurate judgements, also known as
cognitive biases. Over the last 40 years, hundreds of cognitive biases have
been documented, such as the confirmation bias, where people unconsciously
seek out information that confirms their current belief, ignoring information
to the contrary. Despite a growing awareness of the detrimental effects of
cognitive biases on decision making, there is little work on how to detect
this behaviour in those who use visualisation-based applications and even
less on how to minimise their effect. The aim of this workshop is to bring
together people from a wide range of disciplines such as information
visualisation, visual analytics, software engineering, cognitive psychology
and decision science, as well as those close to end-user groups like
intelligence analysts and medical practitioners, to explore some of the ways
in which cognitive biases impact user performance and share ideas about
practical ways to reduce or overcome these potentially harmful effects,
especially in adapting the tools developers design and build.

The pedagogy of data visualization is becoming increasingly important as data
visualization techniques and tools proliferate.  In this workshop, we propose
to create a community of practice that provides a structured medium to learn
from data visualization teaching strategies from each other.  The focus is on
sharing innovations in the classroom when teaching data visualization.  The
half-day interactive workshop will include lightning talks/demonstrations
followed by breakout sessions focused on topics related to teaching large
classes, teaching at a liberal arts college, teaching a professional masters'
course, and so on.

The purpose of this workshop is to propose new research directions in
visualization for the digital humanities, to familiarize the visualization
research community with the problems faced by digital humanities researchers,
and to foster future collaboration between visualization and digital
humanities research.

VADL 2017, the workshop on visual analytics for deep learning, is a half-day
workshop held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS 2017 Conference.  The primary
goal of the workshop is to bridge the gap by bringing together researchers
from both the machine learning and visual analytics fields, which allows us
to push the boundary of deep learning. The workshop should provide an
opportunity to discuss and explore ways to harmonize the power of automated
techniques and exploratory nature of interactive visualization.

Visualization plays an important role in all levels of scholarship, and
across interdisciplinary, research and social landscapes. It is imperative
that the importance and benefits of a field with such far reaching impact
embrace the diverse demographic of the future workforce for whom data
visualization skills will be needed if not required. In order to meet the
growing demand for persons with capacity to utilize data visualization to
solve complex problems in research and in the workforce exposure to data
visualization at all levels is essential. This workshop aims to be a
catalyst for broadening participation of women, members of underrepresented
groups and underrepresented disciplines in visualization, fostering a
community of current and future scholars with interests in visualization
through mentoring and encouraging participants to consider visualization as
a career path. The workshop is designed to inform, inspire and encourage
participants, specifically participants historically underrepresented at the
conference, to engage in the multidisciplinary dynamics of visualization.

The 2017 ViP Workshop on Visualization Solutions in the Wild is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying the latest visualization and visual analytics research to real world problems. It targets work at the interface between visualization research and specific application domains. It is highly interdisciplinary and focused on delivering actual value to users. This year, we specifically focus on *visualization solutions in the wild*, i.e. on tools, systems, or frameworks which are actively used. The workshop will cover all aspects from their initial conception and design, the process of getting them into use, and the long-term work of extending and sustaining them.
