Downtown Phoenix is a young and vibrant community. You will find sports arenas, live music, rooftop lounges, museums, theaters, art galleries and more than 100 restaurants. Enjoy a light rail pub crawl, and indulge in Southern cravings, take a slice of the Phoenix pizza scene and more! It has much to offer people from all walks of life. When walking the streets of downtown, if you see a person in an Orange shirt, these are Downtown Ambassadors. They are there to answer questions and provide you with information about the Downtown area. You can also set up walking tours of downtown through the Downtown Ambassador Program. For more information on this program or a general what’s happening in Downtown Phoenix, you can visit the [Downtown Phoenix website](http://dtphx.org/).

Make sure you check out Roosevelt Row! It is the place to go for coffee shops, art-house movies and First Friday Art Walks. Pro sports are almost always afoot away at Talking Stick Resort Arena (formerly known as US Airways Center and home of the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury) or Chase Field (home of the Arizona Diamondbacks).  Downtown Phoenix is full of family-friendly museums including the Arizona Science Center and Heard Museum!  

Of course, outside of Phoenix, Arizona has much to offer. Hike Camelback Mountain, visit Old Town Scottsdale, explore the Grand Canyon and Sedona! Explore Arizona’s Grand Adventures!
