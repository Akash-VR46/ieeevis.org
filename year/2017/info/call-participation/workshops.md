**New for 2017: Workshop submission date moved up to Feb 15 2017, to allow more time for publicizing accepted workshops.**

We solicit half-day workshops related to all areas of visualization including visual analytics, information visualization, and scientific visualization. The workshops venue at IEEE VIS provides an informal setting for participants to discuss advanced technical topics in visualization, involve experts in the field, disseminate work in progress, and promote new ideas.

Workshops should:

* emphasize emerging ideas, concepts, or technologies that are currently too nascent or too interdisciplinary for a full symposium; or
* bring together experts on a subject to create a report, white-paper, or proposal requiring interactive work sessions that is of potential interest to a substantial segment of the visualization community.

A distinction that separates workshops from tutorials and symposia is that the information flow for a workshop should not be directed solely from the presenters to the audience. Rather, workshops should engage the participation of all attendees. Workshops at IEEE VIS are open to all registered attendees and ‘invitation only’ workshops will not be approved.

Workshop proposals should include:

* a title,
* the contact details of the organizers,
* a brief description of organizers' background, related publications, and research,
* the goals, the technical scope, the mission, and the proposed focus,
* the planned activities, including the schedule during the session (the length should be half day; only in special cases will full day workshops be considered),
* a statement of the organization and the development of the list of participants (intended size, detailed selection procedures and timeline for finalizing workshop presenters),
* the intended result and impact of the workshop,
* the plan for publication (proceedings are entirely optional, but if publication occurs it must happen through the IEEE and materials should be submitted to the IEEE Xplore Digital Library),
* the number of poster slots requested, if the workshop intends to feature posters,
* the proposed dates for the call for participation, author notification, and camera-ready deadlines (author notification must be prior to the early registration deadline of Fri Aug 25 2017; for inclusion of materials on the USB the camera-ready deadline must be prior to Aug 27 2017).

Organizers should also submit the [Requirements Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUeP2GAReaVw-MPM14DuEBAU5gZEE4MSU7uDVy1-9OSUcZpQ/viewform?c=0&w=1) to indicate requested facilities including room setup, any needed supplies or materials, and timing preferences (schedule requests are handled on a best-effort request and cannot always be accommodated).

The proposal should not exceed four pages. Please visit
[http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html)
for details and submit via PCS
[http://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/](http://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/).

The workshops will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

* the potential for inspiring people, being influential, and opening new lines of research,
* the ability to attract people and make them excited about the workshop,
* the appropriateness with respect to IEEE VIS topics,
* the qualifications of the organizers,
* the coherence of the proposed topic, 
* if this workshop is a repeat submission, its previous success, and
* if this workshop has special needs, the feasibility of the proposed plan including financial, logistics, scheduling, and coordination impact.

The workshop organizers will receive the following support from the VIS conference:

* one complimentary 1-day registration for an invited speaker,
* room and AV support suitable for up to 100 attendees,
* food and beverages for attendees: coffee breaks throughout the day, Sunday evening opening reception,
* space in the poster display area, if requested (from limited pool set aside for standard workshops; available space depends on the specifics of the venue; early requests given priority over late requests),  
* PCS (Precision Conference Solutions) support for managing submissions and the review process, if requested,
* inclusion of the workshop materials or proceedings on the USB drive for dissemination to attendees of the conference, if requested (materials must be provided by Aug 27 2017), and 
* IEEE Xplore Digital Library publication of the workshop proceedings, if requested.

If the requirements of the workshop exceed this default support, the workshop organizers are expected to coordinate with the workshop chairs and possibly raise funds to support the workshop activities; fundraising plans must be discussed with the workshop and supporters chairs prior to contacting any potential funder. For more information, see the guidelines for
[Financial and Coordination Policies for IEEE VIS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kp6q93hpP6m0v2gJyqZwRd46nf2baR6q9Dxd39Pkb7Q/edit?usp=sharing).

If the proposed workshop is a follow-up on a previous workshop, please include a discussion of the results and the impact of the previous workshop. The aim of workshops is to include a variety of topics and a healthy mix of new and recurring events.  Repeat submissions will be judged in part by the success of the previous workshop. Workshop success will be measured subjectively, but popularity, research impact, visibility, and attendee feedback will all be taken into account.

In addition, the workshop chairs will try to balance the proposed topics in order to support the diversity of topics within the IEEE VIS venue and complement the main program of the conference.

Accepted workshops are required to prepare a short summary (~50 words) for the printed program; a longer summary of ~90 words may be submitted for the web program, or the short one will be reused.
