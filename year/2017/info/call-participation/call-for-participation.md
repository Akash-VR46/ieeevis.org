**IEEE VIS 2017** is the premier forum for advances in visualization for
academia, government, and industry. This week-long event brings
together researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in
visualization solutions. IEEE VIS 2017 is now soliciting novel
research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of
visualization as captured by the three main conferences:
 
* IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science & Technology (VAST)
* IEEE Conference on Information Visualization (InfoVis)
* IEEE Conference on Scientific Visualization (SciVis)

As the leading academic event on visualization research, VIS expects
important, impactful, and potentially transformative
contributions. Submissions will be judged on their importance,
potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings,
appropriateness of methodology, and the process followed. Please
submit your best work.

## Conference-Specific Information

The three conferences at IEEE VIS 2017 use the same submission and
review process. The conferences differ in the topics, emphasis, paper
types, and approach, as described in the conference-specific calls for
papers below. Each such call lists different paper types, example
papers, and program committees:

* Paper types and topics: [VAST](vast-paper-types), [InfoVis](infovis-paper-types), and [SciVis](scivis-paper-types).
* Program committees: [VAST](../committees/vast-program-committee), [InfoVis](../committees/infovis-program-committee), and [SciVis](../committees/scivis-program-committee).

## Submission Guidelines

When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the [paper submission guidelines](paper-submission-guidelines) (common to all three conferences).

## Publication

Full papers accepted to IEEE VIS will appear in a special issue of the
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). This
journal special issue will have the publication date of January 2018
and will be published online the first day of the conference (October
1, 2017); individual paper preprints will be available for online
Early Access by September 1, 2017. Papers (including supplemental
material) are only conditionally accepted, and will undergo a full
revision and review cycle after initial notification of review
results. During this time, reviewers will ensure that necessary
conditions for acceptance have been met in the new revision. The paper
and supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE Digital
Library, subject to its standard terms and conditions.

Note that IEEE VAST has a special "conference paper" track for
publication. Conference papers are full papers, and also considered
archival. They are published as part of the conference proceedings of
IEEE VAST, but are not part of the IEEE TVCG special issue for the
conference. See the
[VAST paper types and topics document](vast-paper-types) for more
details.
