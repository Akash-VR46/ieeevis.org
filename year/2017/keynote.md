  <strong>Jacqueline H. Chen </strong><br />is a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at the Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Laboratories.  She has contributed broadly to research in petascale direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent combustion focusing on fundamental turbulence-chemistry interactions. These benchmark simulations  provide fundamental insight into combustion processes and are used by the combustion modeling community to develop and validate turbulent combustion models for engineering CFD simulations.  In collaboration with computer scientists and applied mathematicians she is the founding Director of the Center for Exascale Simulation of Combustion in Turbulence (ExaCT).  She leads an interdisciplinary team to co-design DNS algorithms, domain-specific programming environments,  scientific data management and in situ uncertainty quantification and analytics, and architectural simulation and modeling with combustion proxy and production applications.  She received the DOE INCITE Award in 2005, 2007, 2008-2014, the Asian American Engineer of the Year Award in 2009, and the Sandia OE Adams Award in 2012.  She is a member of the DOE Advanced Scientific Computing Research Advisory Committee (ASCAC) and Subcommittees on Exascale Computing, and Synergies of Big Data and Exascale.  She is the editor of Flow, Turbulence and Combustion, the co-editor of the Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, volumes 29 and 30, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Combustion Institute.
