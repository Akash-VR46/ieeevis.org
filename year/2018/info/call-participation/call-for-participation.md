**IEEE VIS 2018** is the premier forum for advances in visualization for academia, government, and industry. This week-long event brings together researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in visualization solutions. IEEE VIS 2018 is now soliciting novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization as captured by the three main conferences:

IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science & Technology (VAST)

IEEE Conference on Information Visualization (InfoVis)

IEEE Conference on Scientific Visualization (SciVis)

As the leading academic event on visualization research, VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their importance, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the process followed. Please submit your best work.

## Conference-Specific Information

The three conferences at IEEE VIS 2018 use the same submission and review process. The conferences differ in the topics, emphasis, paper types, and approach, as described in the conference-specific calls for papers below. Each such call lists different paper types, example papers, and program committees:

* Paper types and topics: [VAST](vast-paper-types), [InfoVis](infovis-paper-types), and [SciVis](scivis-paper-types).
* Program committees: [VAST](../committees/vast-program-committee), [InfoVis](../committees/infovis-program-committee), and [SciVis](../committees/scivis-program-committee).

## Submission Guidelines

When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the [paper submission guidelines](paper-submission-guidelines) (common to all three conferences).

## Publication

Full papers accepted to IEEE VIS will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). This journal special issue will have the publication date of January 2019 and will be published online the first day of the conference (October 21, 2018); individual paper preprints will be available for online Early Access by September 1, 2018. Papers (including supplemental material) are only conditionally accepted, and will undergo a full revision and review cycle after initial notification of review results. During this time, reviewers will ensure that necessary conditions for acceptance have been met in the new revision. The paper and supplemental material will also be submitted to the IEEE Digital Library, subject to its standard terms and conditions.

Note that IEEE VAST has a special “conference paper” track for publication. Conference papers are full papers, and also considered archival. They are published as part of the conference proceedings of IEEE VAST, but are not part of the IEEE TVCG special issue for the conference. See the [VAST paper types and topics document](vast-paper-types) for more details.
