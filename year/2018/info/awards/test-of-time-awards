## To improve the future, we must reflect on our past.

The IEEE VIS Test of Time Award is an accolade given to recognize *articles* published at previous conferences whose contents are still vibrant and useful today and have had a major impact and influence within and beyond the visualization community.

By making the awards at the conference opening we hope to encourage researchers to aim  to produce work that is forward looking and has transformational potential. We're trying to build on our heritage to establish an ambitious future by making it clear at the conference opening that we want participants to aspire to be writing the papers that will be relevant in 10 and 20 years.

Papers are selected for each of the three conferences (VAST, InfoVis and SciVis) by Test of Time Awards panels. These panels are appointed by each conference Steering Committee.

The decisions are based on objective measures such as the numbers of citations, and more subjective ones such as the quality and longevity and influence of ideas, outreach, uptake and effect not only in the research community, but also within application domains and visualization practice.

VAST currently considers conferences 10 years prior to the current conference.

InfoVis currently considers conferences 10 and 20 years prior to the current conference.

SciVis currently considers 15 and 25 years prior to the current conference.
