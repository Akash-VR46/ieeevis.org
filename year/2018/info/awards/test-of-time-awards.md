## To improve the future, we must reflect on our past.

The IEEE VIS Test of Time Award is an accolade given to recognize *articles* published at previous conferences whose contents are still vibrant and useful today and have had a major impact and influence within and beyond the visualization community.

By making the awards at the conference opening we hope to encourage researchers to aim  to produce work that is forward looking and has transformational potential. We're trying to build on our heritage to establish an ambitious future by making it clear at the conference opening that we want participants to aspire to be writing the papers that will be relevant in 10 and 20 years.

Papers are selected for each of the three conferences (VAST, InfoVis and SciVis) by Test of Time Awards panels. These panels are appointed by each conference Steering Committee.

The decisions are based on objective measures such as the numbers of citations, and more subjective ones such as the quality and longevity and influence of ideas, outreach, uptake and effect not only in the research community, but also within application domains and visualization practice.

VAST currently considers conferences 10 years prior to the current conference.

InfoVis currently considers conferences 10 and 20 years prior to the current conference.

SciVis currently considers 15 and 25 years prior to the current conference.

## VAST 2008: 10 Years Test of Time Award 
**Spatio-temporal Aggregation for Visual Analysis of Movements** 
Authors: Gennady Andrienko and Natalia Andrienko 

Proc. IEEE VAST 2008, pages 51-58, 2008.

## InfoVis 
**1998: An Operator Interaction Framework For Visualization Systems** 
Authors: Chi, E.H.; Riedl, J. 

The operator interaction framework established a foundation for understanding interaction in InfoVis by characterizing actions or ‘operators’ in relation to the visualization pipeline. The model introduced in this work helps both system designers and end users understand and predict the effects of interaction by identifying that they occur at different levels of abstraction. As such, it is a foundational work contributing to the visualization reference model and it established an important basis for engineering of interaction in visualization systems. The paper has been extensively cited, including many recent citations, indicating its continued relevance even 20 years later.

**2008: Effectiveness of Animation in Trend Visualization** 
Authors: George G. Robertson; Roland Fernandez; Danyel Fisher; Bongshin Lee; John T. Stasko 

Inspired by the Roslings’ Gapminder, Robertson et al. conducted experiments to establish whether and when the animated transitions used in Trendalyzer might be effective. Their comparison of three trend visualization methods found small multiples to be preferable for analysis but animation to be fastest for presentation, enjoyable, exciting and error-prone. These empirical findings draw attention to some of the difficult trade-offs encountered in visualization, helping designers navigate the evolving design space for exploration and communication with some confidence in knowledge of the likely implications of their decisions. The work itself has been widely accepted, broadly cited and applied by many in visualization design contexts. It has seeded follow up studies and acted as a model for the controlled empirical study of dynamic visualization in use and can inspire others to assess the efficacy of emerging visualization methods.
