The proceedings of VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis are published as a special issue of the flagship journal IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). The special issue has the publication date of January in the following year and is published online the first day of the conference, with [Early Access preprints](https://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tg/preprint/index.html) publicly available by Sep 1. All authors of regular TVCG papers from the previous year in the area of visualization have been invited to give an oral presentation about their work at VIS; these talks are integrated within the topical papers sessions. This closely coupled relationship between TVCG and VIS supports the timely exchange of new ideas and rapid dissemination of visualization research via an integrated forum for both publications and presentations. 

The VAST Conference-only Track features additional papers with innovative advances and applications in visual analytics that may have foci outside the scope of TVCG; these full archival papers will appear in the IEEE Digital Library. These talks are also integrated within the topical papers sessions.
	
In addition, authors of papers from the IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications (CG&A) from the previous year in the area of visualization have been invited to give an oral presentation about their work at VIS; these talks are collected into two CG&A-focused sessions.
