### The VIS Restructuring Committee (2016-2018)

The VIS Restructuring Committee was tasked in 2016 by the VEC (VIS Executive Committee) with considering alternative structures, such as a more unified conference, that may better enhance vibrancy and growth. It has generated the following documents:

* [VIS Restructuring Recommendations, Fall 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1810-Restructuring-Recommendations.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Workshop Executive Summary, Fall 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1809-Restructuring-Workshops-Executive-Summary.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Workshops Summary, Fall 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1810-Restructuring-Workshops-Summary.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Feedback, January 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1801-Restructuring-Feedback.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Report ("Phoenix Report"), Fall 2017](http://ieeevis.org/governance/170925-Restructuring-Slides.pdf)

**Committee Members**: Hanspeter Pfister (chair), Hans Hagen, Daniel Keim, Tamara Munzner, Stephen

The VIS Restructuring Committee has concluded its work and has spawned new committees with a more specific mandate in 2019. 

### The reVISe Committee (2019-ongoing)

The reVISe committee was formed in early 2019 with the goal of proposing a specific proposal for re-organizing the academic conferences (VAST, InfoVis, SciVis) under a single umbrella. 

The reVISe committee has defined the following design goals for that proposal: 

1. Developing one or a small number of concrete proposals for an area model for research papers (or other models that substantially differ from the current V-I-S split). 
2. Defining objective criteria for creating new areas and merging existing areas in the future, including     
    1. thinking about how to and if to bring in associated events, and
    2. thinking about how to capture newly appearing topics that may bring in new audiences and contributors.
3. Developing a full proposal for the mechanics of how the model would work, beyond the specifics of the areas. 
4. Be informed about and inspired by similar approaches to submissions in other conferences.
5. Inform the community, take feedback into account, and build support for a new model.
6. Define transition guidelines from current to new area model.
7. Develop a concrete proposal for changing the governance structures of the conference that are appropriately aligned with and reflect the repercussions of the proposed model, including 
    1. organizing committee structure, and
    2. steering committee structure and charter.
    
The reVISe Committee meets weekly and makes its minutes as well as other pertinent documents available on this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A7iVpl7N-D3yfx4lY1bLG8ZjDHJPj0wauY3ywI-xwFU).
