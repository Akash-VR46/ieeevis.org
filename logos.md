# Step 1) upload the logo

Upload logos to the [appropriate year in the supporters folder](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/tree/master/attachments/supporters).

See "Upload Files" in the top right.

# Step 2) modify the logos file

Add a JSON entry to the end of [the all sponsors file](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/blob/master/js/all_sponsors.json).

There you can specify additional fields including `class` such as `Diamond` and `href` for a link to the sponsor's website.
