# Step 1) upload the logo

Upload logos to the [appropriate year in the supporters folder](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/tree/master/attachments/supporters).

See "Upload Files" in the top right.

Convenience link: [direct link to the 2018 upload](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/upload/master/attachments/supporters/2018).

# Step 2) modify the logos file

Add a JSON entry to the end of [the all sponsors file](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/blob/master/js/all_sponsors.json).

There you can specify additional fields including `class` such as `Diamond` and `href` for a link to the sponsor's website.

Convenience link: [direct link to editing all sponsors](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis.org/edit/master/js/all_sponsors.json).

At this point, the logos should automatically show on our staging page.
